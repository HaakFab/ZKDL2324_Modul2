economy is mostly based on agricultural yield growth and linked agro industry products, as it is an agricultural country. Rainwater, which is often unpredictable in India, has a significant impact on agriculture. Agriculture growth is also influenced by a variety of soil parameters, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as crop rotation, soil moisture, and surface temperature, as well as climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall. India is quickly advancing in terms of technical advancement. As a result, technology will benefit agriculture by increasing crop productivity, resulting in higher yields for farmers. The suggested project provides a solution for storing temperature, rainfall, and soil characteristics in order to determine which crops are suited for cultivation in a given area. This paper describes a system, implemented as an android application, that employs data analytics techniques to predict the most profitable crop based on current weather and soil conditions. The suggested system will combine data from the repository and the meteorological department to make a prediction of the most suited crops based on current environmental conditions using a machine learning method called Multiple Linear Regression. This gives a farmer a wide range of crops to choose from. As a result, the project creates a system that integrates data from diverse sources, performs data analytics, and conducts predictive analysis in order to improve crop production productivity and boost farmer profit margins over time. Machine learning, crop prediction, and yield estimation are some of the terms used in this paper.

One of the most powerful tools in faults detection and diagnosis is artificial intelligence AI . Faults should be detected early so correct mitigation measures can be taken, whilst false alarms should be eschewed to avoid unnecessary interruption and downtime. For the last few decades there has been major interest towards intelligent condition monitoring system ICMS application in power plant especially with AI development particularly in artificial neural network ANN . ANN is based on quite simple principles, but takes advantage of their mathematical nature, non linear iteration to demonstrate powerful problem solving ability. With massive possibility and room for improvement in AI, the inspiration for researching them are apparent, and literally, hundreds of papers have been published, discussing the findings of hybrid AI for condition monitoring purposes. In this paper, the studies of ANN and fuzzy logic application will be presented. P. Naveen | S. Nikitha | P. Sudeesh | V.

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a \u2018good\u2019 explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology\/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.","1006":"Both Simulation and Artificial Intelligence try to model reality for problem solving and decision making. In this paper, we propose a framework for integrating the two areas by uncovering fundamental similarities between them and opportunities for combining them which can be mutually useful. The framework also shows the potential gains for Simulation by applying Artificial Intelligence concepts (mainly expert systems) to assist in the simulation process and reveals in an organised way the potential gains for Artificial Intelligence by applying concepts derived from Simulation.","1007":"Artificial Intelligence AI is a growing field at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, and engineering, focused on creating machines capable of intelligent behavior. Over the years, AI has evolved from rule based systems to data driven approaches, prominently leveraging machine learning and deep learning. This evolution has led to AI systems capable of complex tasks such as pattern recognition, natural language processing, and decision making. The applications of AI are vast and diverse, permeating industries like healthcare, finance, automotive, retail, and education. AI driven technologies enable efficient automation, precise data analysis, personalized experiences, and improved decision making. However, with these advancements come ethical and culture concerns, including biases, data privacy, job displacement, and the responsible development and deployment of AI. Striking a balance between AIs potential and its associated risks necessitates a holistic approach, incorporating transparency, fairness, robust regulations, and ongoing research. This abstract encapsulates AIs transformative potential, emphasizing the importance of responsible AI development to ensure a positive impact on society while mitigating risks.

Artificial intelligence has advanced to occupy a position of paramount importance in Science, but seldom do we associate it with Human Creativity in general, and with Modern Art in particular. Creativity is one of the rudimentary constituents of the functioning of machines. By using algorithms, machines churn out representations of shapes, images and structures. Machines are perpetually expanding, redefining and reinventing creativity in their own right. This idea has triggered the birth of a new subfield in Artificial Intelligence known as Computational Creativity. This paper analyzes the diverse ways in which the integrated algorithms of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are cut for producing breakthroughs in the field of 21st Century Modern Arts.

Symbolic artificial intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data, and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for downstream processing. This short review highlights recent progress in this direction.","1018":"This paper provides detailed understanding about the role of ethics in artificial intelligence.

One of the emerging methods for increasing trust in AI systems is to use eXplainable AI (XAI), which promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions AI systems make. Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.","1022":"Technology is evolving every day and the latest trends in Artificial Intelligence have made dental procedures less time consuming and minimally invasive.

The change of preference was due to a vast emerging concept called \u00c4U\"\u009d. AU is the use or introduction of automatic equipment in the process of manufacturing or other processes and facility. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the concept that evolved from AU. Artificial Intelligence is the process of simulation of human intelligence in machines. Humans are unaware of the fact that their job opportunities are being taken over by a machine simulated by human intelligence. In recent years, many law firms started to engage their firms with an AI in their legal research. Our paper traces the evolution of the relationship between technology and human productivity from a contemporary perspective with special reference to HR as well as speculates on the possible answers to emerging problems. The main question is whether an AI taking over the legal sector or any other sectors affects the basic HR? HR is a right which is believed to belong to every person. Here, in this case, the basic right of getting a proper livelihood is being affected.

In fact it is impossible to determine whether a given object is \"really\" represented as a list, a vector, a hash table, a function, or a process. The architecture will efficiently run the coming generation of PLANNER-like artificial intelligence languages including those requiring a high degree of parallelism. The efficiency is gained without loss of programming generality because it only makes certain actors more efficient; it does not change their behavioral characteristics. The architecture is general with respect to control structure and does not have or need goto, interrupt, or semaphore primitives.

It is the main cause of the success of a business. The evaluation of employee performance is a very important task as it shows how the employees skills are improving. The HR department is responsible for this task. The employee performance evaluation is complex and time consuming. In the last decade, information technology tools have undergone a huge evolution and can help with this complex task. Artificial Intelligence AI is a recent science that consists of building systems that imitate human behavior. It is widely used in many applications like healthcare, banking, and finance. This thesis focuses on studying the impact of artificial intelligence on the employee evaluation process. An analytical descriptive methodology was used. Intelligence is considered an independent variable. However, employee performance evaluation is the dependent variable DV . Four dimensions of the DV were considered objectives and key results, skills gap analysis, tracking training completion, and project or task management tools. A questionnaire of 34 items was built and distributed to the IT employees of the Babylon Education Directorate. 295 answers were collected. SPSS software was used to examine the answers. The MANOVA test was applied to validate the study hypotheses. The result shows that AI has a significant positive impact on the evaluation of employees performance in all dimensions.

Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery.","1071":"Table of Contents\n\n                 Artificial Intelligence and Geography.\n\n                 A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n                 Heuristic Search in Geography.\n\n                 Expert Systems and Intelligent Knowledge-based\n                 Systems.\n\n                 Neurocomputing.\n\n                 Applying Artificial Neural Networks.\n\n                 Evolutionary Computation, Genetic Algorithms, Evolution\n                 Strategies and Genetic Programming.\n\n                 Artificial Life.\n\n                 Fuzzy Logic, Fuzzy Systems and Soft\n                 Computing.\n\n                 Conclusions and Epilogue.\n\n                 Index.","1072":"In a democracy, the link between government and society is fundamental to prevent corruption and to ensure the functioning of mechanisms for transparency, accountability of the guaranteeing bodies and access to information.

Artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) opens new opportunities, potentials, and challenges in educational practices. In its short history, AIEd has been undergoing several paradigmatic shifts, which are characterized into three paradigms in this position paper: AI-directed, learner-as-recipient, AI-supported, learner-as-collaborator, and AI-empowered, learner-as-leader. In three paradigms, AI techniques are used to address educational and learning issues in varied ways. AI is used to represent knowledge models and direct cognitive learning while learners are recipients of AI service in Paradigm One; AI is used to support learning while learners work as collaborators with AI in Paradigm Two; AI is used to empower learning while learners take agency to learn in Paradigm Three. Overall, the development trend of AIEd has been developing to empower learner agency and personalization, enable learners to reflect on learning and inform AI systems to adapt accordingly, and lead to an iterative development of the learner-centered, data-driven, personalized learning.","1079":"In the past twenty years, much time, effort, and money has been expended on designing an unambiguous representation of natural language to make them accessible to computer processing, These efforts have centered around creating schemata designed to parallel logical relations with relations expressed by the syntax and semantics of natural languages, which are clearly cumbersome and ambiguous in their function as vehicles for the transmission of logical data. Understandably, there is a widespread belief that natural languages are unsuitable for the transmission of many ideas that artificial languages can render with great precision and mathematical rigor. But this dichotomy, which has served as a premise underlying much work in the areas of linguistics and artificial intelligence, is a false one. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millenia old. First, a typical Knowledge Representation Scheme (using Semantic Nets) will be laid out, followed by an outline of the method used by the ancient Indian grammarians to analyze sentences unambiguously. Finally, the clear parallelism between the two will be demonstrated, and the theoretical implications of this equivalence will be given.","1080":"This book is one of the oldest and most popular introductions to artificial intelligence.

Detailed modeling and control strategies of the overall system has been developed. It is found that under the proposed control strategy the system runs smoothly under randomly and quickly varying wind condition. During both symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault conditions, the system is found stable. Results shows that by using Current Source Inverter CSI stability of wind power can be achieved.

In\n\torder to make advances it is important that the theories and principles\n\twhich guide this central activity are uncovered and analysed in a\n\tsystematic and rigourous manner. To this end, this paper models agent\n\tcommunities using a distributed goal search formalism, and argues\n\tthat commitments (pledges to undertake a specific course of action)\n\tand conventions (means of monitoring commitments in changing circumstances)\n\tare the foundation of coordination in all DAI systems.","1126":"Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of artificial intelligence as a serious science and engineering discipline.

The aim is to find a feasible solution which satisfies a maximum number of constraints within a reasonable amount of time. An AI system in this domain should not replicate the human scheduler but extend his capabilities by doing more problem solving than was manually possible. The constraints are used to help reduce the search space. This paper reviews various AI techniques used in constraint based scheduling, by comparing existing systems. The aim is to help future research concerning the application of AI to constraint based scheduling, by evaluating the progress that has been made in this area.","1133":"There is no doubt, that Artificial Intelligent (AI) has a lot of contributions to the overall well-being of humanity and improving productivity, it is worth noting that there is also a negative impact associated with the use of the technology on ethical grounds ranging from privacy issue to lack of transparency. Quite a lot of work has been done to provide best practices in the development and use of these systems to gain the acceptance of the public; this is very essential for nations to exploit the full potential of AI. This work brings to the frontlines some of the risks\/issues associated with AI from different pieces of literature and provides commonplace or leading principles and frameworks required to develop responsible AI or autonomous systems. The guidelines encourage stakeholders in the industry of developing AI systems to incorporate facilities that support transparency, privacy protection, accountability, and contestability. These guidelines are not new, but they are contextualized to suit ethics in AI. Above all, AI systems should not be seen as being equal to or greater than man, but rather be seen as augmenting intelligent systems to assist human who is the only moral agents.","1134":"This study examines the effect of information and communication technology ICT on human resource management performance through the mediating role represented by artificial intelligence AI within human resource departments and the IT division. Using survey data including 179 respondents and a factor analysis framework, we find that ICT engagement, as measured by management decision support systems, enterprise resource planning ERP , data access and analysis DAA technologies, process support and improvement PSI technologies, and communication technologies, has a positive and statistically significant effect on human resource management performance. Similarly, we find that artificial intelligence and information and communication technologies are positively associated with human resource management performance. The results imply that companies should do their best to promote and facilitate the engagement of ICT and AI to improve their HRM performance as well as their information system, which will produce positive results for the company structure.

It is now transitioning from the hands of experts in computer sciences to biomedical researchers. Here, we introduce recent developments in DL applied to microscopy, in a manner accessible to non-experts. We give an overview of its concepts, capabilities and limitations, presenting applications in image segmentation, classification and restoration. We discuss how DL shows an outstanding potential to push the limits of microscopy, enhancing resolution, signal and information content in acquired data. Its pitfalls are discussed, along with the future directions expected in this field.","1136":"This chapter traces the ethical issues around applying artificial intelligence (AI) in education from the early days of artificial intelligence in education in the 1970s to the current state of this field, including the increasing sophistication of the system interfaces and the rise in data use and misuse. While in the early days most tools were largely learner-facing, now there are tools that are teacher-facing, supporting their management of the classroom, and administrator-facing, assisting in their management of cohorts of students. Learner-facing tools now take into account the affective and motivational aspects of learning as well as the cognitive. The rise of data collection and its associated analytic tools has enabled the development of dashboards for the dynamic management and reflective understanding of learners, teachers, and administrators. Ethical issues hardly figured in the early days of the field but now they loom large. This is because of the legitimate fears that learners' and teachers' autonomy will be compromised, that learner data will be collected and potentially misappropriated for other purposes, and that AI will introduce extra biases into educational decisions and increase existing inequity and also because of the scary reputation that AI has in general.","1139":"We have been using robots in our artificial intelligence course since fall 2000. We have been using the robots for open-laboratory projects. The projects are designed to emphasize high-level knowledge-based AI algorithms.

(ii) What advantages, if any, can be attributed to using robots for AI projects? (iii) What are the downsides of using robots for traditional projects in AI? In this article we discuss the results of our evaluation and list the lessons learned.","1140":"'Decision Theory = Probability + Utility Theory' plus 'Universal Induction = Ockham + Bayes + Turing' results in '= A Unified View of Artificial Intelligence'. This book presents sequential decision theory from a novel algorithmic information theory perspective. While the former is suited for active agents in known environments, the latter is suited for passive prediction in unknown environments. The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment. Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations to other approaches to AI. One intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.","1141":"Ethics is a central and growing concern in all applications utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). Earth observation (EO) and remote sensing (RS) research relies heavily on both big data and AI or machine learning (ML). While this reliance is not new, with increasing image resolutions and the growing number of EO\/RS use cases that have a direct impact on governance, policy, and the lives of people, ethical issues are taking center stage. In this article, we provide scientists engaged with AI for EO (AI4EO) research, 1) a practically useful overview of the key ethical issues emerging in this field, with concrete examples from within EO\/RS to explain these issues, and 2) a first road map (flowchart) that scientists can use to identify ethical issues in their ongoing research. With this, we aim to sensitize scientists to these issues and create a bridge to facilitate constructive and regular communication among scientists engaged in AI4EO research, on the one hand, and ethics research, on the other hand. The article also provides detailed illustrations from four AI4EO research fields to explain how scientists can redesign research questions to more effectively grab ethical opportunities to address real-world problems that are otherwise akin to ethical dilemmas with no win-win solution in sight. The article concludes by providing recommendations to institutions that want to support ethically mindful AI4EO research and provides suggestions for future research in this field.","1142":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a big field, and this is a big book.

The book is also big because we go into some depth. The subtitle of this book is \u201cA Modern Approach.\u201d The intended meaning of this rather empty phrase is that we have tried to synthesize what is now known into a common framework, rather than trying to explain each subfield of AI in its own historical context.

These technologies have many widely beneficial applications, ranging from machine translation to medical image analysis. Countless more such applications are being developed and can be expected over the long term. Less attention has historically been paid to the ways in which artificial intelligence can be used maliciously. This report surveys the landscape of potential security threats from malicious uses of artificial intelligence technologies, and proposes ways to better forecast, prevent, and mitigate these threats. We analyze, but do not conclusively resolve, the question of what the long-term equilibrium between attackers and defenders will be. We focus instead on what sorts of attacks we are likely to see soon if adequate defenses are not developed.\r\nThe report builds on a 2 day workshop held in Oxford, UK, in February 2017.

Instead, I have attempted here to describe fundamental AI ideas that underlie many of these applications. My organization of these ideas is not, then, based on the subject matter of their application, but is, instead, based on general computational concepts involving the kinds of data structures used, the types of operations performed on these data structures, and the properties of control strategies used by AI systems.

This complexity greatly impedes its understanding. The standard approach to the calculation of the behaviour of the living cell, or part thereof, integrates all the rate equations of the individual processes. If successful extremely intensive calculations often lead the calculation of coherent, apparently simple, cellular \"decisions\" taken in response to a signal: the complexity of the behavior of the cell is often smaller than it might have been. The \"decisions\" correspond to the activation of entire functional units of molecular processes, rather than individual ones. The limited complexity of signal and response suggests that there might be a simpler way to model at least some important aspects of cell function. In the field of Artificial Intelligence, such simpler modelling methods for complex systems have been developed. In this paper, it is shown how the Artificial Intelligence description method for deliberative agents functioning on the basis of beliefs, desires and intentions as known in Artificial Intelligence, can be used successfully to describe essential aspects of cellular regulation. This is demonstrated for catabolite repression and substrate induction phenomena in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The method becomes highly efficient when the computation is automated in a Prolog implementation. By defining in a qualitative way the food supply of the bacterium, the make-up of its catabolic pathways is readily calculated for cases that are sufficiently complex to make the traditional human reasoning tedious and error prone.","1174":"Software has partially or fully displaced many former human activities, such as catching speeders or flying airplanes, and proven itself able to surpass humans in certain contests, like Chess and Go.

For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.","1197":"According to this fact that educational system is the base of constant development in every country and this\r\nsystem educates human-forces and this forces,are accelerators and a factor, of achieving the goals of\r\ndevelopment,the educational system can play, Major role in the context economic behavior, in this context\r\nsome concepts are regarded as behavioral targets and performance.In educational system, handling\r\nartificial intelligence, in teaching and learning process, had a surprising evolution through educational\r\nadvantages, making job, respecting customers rights and customer relationship management, to assist\r\npriority and citizenship, correct investment through formal markets.

The main aim of this paper is to build an Artificial Intelligent System that after analysis of certain parameters can predict that whether a person is diabetic or not. Diabetes is the name used to describe a metabolic condition of having higher than normal blood sugar levels. Diabetes is becoming increasingly more common throughout the world, due to increased obesity - which can lead to metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes leading to higher incidences of type 2 diabetes. Authors have identified 10 parameters that play an important role in diabetes and prepared a rich database of training data which served as the backbone of the prediction algorithm. Keeping in view this training data authors developed a system that uses the artificial neural networks algorithm to serve the purpose. These are capable of predicting new observations (on specific variables) from previous observations (on the same or other variables) after executing a process of so-called learning from existing training data (Haykin1998).The results indicate that the ANN is the best predictor with the accuracy of about 96%. This system can be used to assist medical programs especially in geographically remote areas where expert human diagnosis not possible with an advantage of minimal expenses and faster results.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.

Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set. Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples. Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness.

Generative artificial intelligence is having a profound impact on our lives and work, with one of the most critical aspects being its algorithms. These algorithms directly influence the learning performance of the entire intelligent system and the quality of recommendations. However, with the widespread application of algorithms and the continuous evolution of artificial intelligence, a series of regulatory and management issues have arisen. Many countries worldwide are continually strengthening algorithm oversight to ensure transparency, fairness, and security. This project, part of a university student innovation training program, will primarily focus on researching personal information security risks among the potential risks associated with generative artificial intelligence.

It would have been better\n\tto have reviewed my previous work rather than attempt something new,\n\tbut such was not my custom at that time. I am grateful to ACM for\n\tthe opportunity to try again. Unfortunately for our science, although\n\tperhaps fortunately for this project, the problem of generality in\n\tartificial intelligence (AI) is almost as unsolved as ever, although\n\twe now have many ideas not available in 1971.

It was obvious in 1971 and even in 1958\n\tthat AI programs suffered from a lack of generality. It is still\n\tobvious; there are many more details. The first gross symptom is\n\tthat a small addition to the idea of a program often involves a complete\n\trewrite beginning with the data structures. Some progress has been\n\tmade in modularizing data structures, but small modifications of\n\tthe search strategies are even less likely to be accomplished without\n\trewriting. Another symptom is no one knows how to make a general\n\tdatabase of commonsense knowledge that could be used by any program\n\tthat needed the knowledge. Along with other information, such a database\n\twould contain what a robot would need to know about the effects of\n\tmoving objects around, what a person can be expected to know about\n\this family, and the facts about buying and selling. This does not\n\tdepend on whether the knowledge is to be expressed in a logical language\n\tor in some other formalism. When we take the logic approach to AI,\n\tlack of generality shows up in that the axioms we devise to express\n\tcommonsense knowledge are too restricted in their applicability for\n\ta general commonsense database. In my opinion, getting a language\n\tfor expressing general commonsense knowledge for inclusion in a general\n\tdatabase is the key problem of generality in AI.

The article starts with taking the perspective of EU labour law influencing the development of AI systems used in the employment context. We argue that providers should respect EU labour law throughout the development of the AI system (section 2). Then, the areas where EU labour law and the AI overlap are identified, thereby viewing it from an employer's perspective, i.e., the user of the AI system (section 3). Using two specific EU labour law areas (the right not to be discriminated against and the right to healthy and safe working conditions) the article provides a first assessment of how the AI Act might influence work and the regulation thereof (section 4). Finally, the conclusion critically explores whether and to what extent AI in employment situations warrants particular attention (section 5).","1341":null,"1342":"We use a generic formalism designed to search for relations in\r\nhigh-dimensional spaces to determine if the total mass of a subhalo can be\r\npredicted from other internal properties such as velocity dispersion, radius,\r\nor star-formation rate.

Furthermore, EHRs are increasingly likely to\r\ninclude data relating to patient outcomes, functionality such as clinical\r\ndecision support, and genetic information as well, and, as such, can be seen as\r\nrepositories of increasingly valuable information about patients' health\r\nconditions and responses to treatment over time. Methods: We describe a case\r\nstudy of 423 patients treated by Centerstone within Tennessee and Indiana in\r\nwhich we utilized electronic health record data to generate predictive\r\nalgorithms of individual patient treatment response. Multiple models were\r\nconstructed using predictor variables derived from clinical, financial and\r\ngeographic data. Results: For the 423 patients, 101 deteriorated, 223 improved\r\nand in 99 there was no change in clinical condition. Based on modeling of\r\nvarious clinical indicators at baseline, the highest accuracy in predicting\r\nindividual patient response ranged from 70-72% within the models tested.

An RTS AI controlled opponent named \"KAI\" is implemented for the \"TA Spring\" game engine in order to advance the state of the art in usin AI techniques in games and to gain some insight into the strengths and weaknesses of AI Controlled Player (AI CP) architectures.A goal was to create an AI with behavior that gave the impression of intelligence to the human player, by taking on certain aspects of the style in which human players play the game. Another goal for the benefit of the TA Spring development community was to create an AI which played with sufficient skill to provide experienced players with resistance, without using obvious means of cheating such as getting free resources or military assets.Several common techniques were used, among others Rule-based decision making, path planning and path replanning, influence maps, and a variant of the A* search algorithm was used for searches of various kinds. The AI also has an approach to micromanagement of units that are fighting in combination with influence maps. The AI CP program was repeatedly tested against human players and other AI CP programs in various settings throughout development. The availability of testing by the community but the sometimes sketchy feedback lead to the production of consistent behavior for tester and developer alike in order to progress. One obstacle that was met was that the rule-based approach to combat behavior resulted in high complexity.The architecture of the RTS AI CP is designed to emerge a strategy from separate agents that were situation aware. Both the actions of the enemy and the properties of the environment are taken into account. The overall approach is to strengthen the AI CP through better economic and military decisions. Micromanagement and frequent updates for moving units is an important part of improving military decisions in this architecture.This thesis goes into the topics of RTS strategies, tactics, economic decisions and military decisions and how they may be made by AI in an informed way. Direct attempts at calculation and prediction rather than having the AI learn from experience resulted in behavior that was superior to most AI CPs and many human players without a learning period.

A great difficulty in this regard is ensuring transparency, accountability, responsibility, and the ability to make revisions, as well as preventing hidden discrimination.

Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Different machine learning algorithms were trained and validated to detect cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury within 12 hours after surgery. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, preoperative cardiac status, intra- and postoperative variables including creatinine and hemoglobin values were retrieved for analysis. \r\n\r\nResults: From 7507 patients analyzed, 1699 patients (22.6 %) developed cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.

Ontologies play a central role in the development of the Semantic Web, since they provide a precise definition of shared terms in web resources. They are expressed in the standardized web ontology language OWL, which consists of the three increasingly expressive sublanguages OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. The sublanguages OWL Lite and OWL DL have a formal semantics and a reasoning support through a mapping to the expressive description logics and , respectively. In this paper, we present the expressive probabilistic description logics P- and P-, which are probabilistic extensions of these description logics. They allow for expressing rich terminological probabilistic knowledge about concepts and roles as well as assertional probabilistic knowledge about instances of concepts and roles. They are semantically based on the notion of probabilistic lexicographic entailment from probabilistic default reasoning, which naturally interprets this terminological and assertional probabilistic knowledge as knowledge about random and concrete instances, respectively. As an important additional feature, they also allow for expressing terminological default knowledge, which is semantically interpreted as in Lehmann's lexicographic entailment in default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. Another important feature of this extension of and by probabilistic uncertainty is that it can be applied to other classical description logics as well. We then present sound and complete algorithms for the main reasoning problems in the new probabilistic description logics, which are based on reductions to reasoning in their classical counterparts, and to solving linear optimization problems. In particular, this shows the important result that reasoning in the new probabilistic description logics is decidable\/computable. Furthermore, we also analyze the computational complexity of the main reasoning problems in the new probabilistic description logics in the general as well as restricted cases.","1462":"ObjectivesClinical guidelines (GLs) are assuming a major role in the medical area, in order to grant the quality of the medical assistance and to optimize medical treatments within healthcare organizations.

These artificial intelligent systems support the clinical decision making by anticipating the diagnostic results once they are trained using previously acquired training data. The use of Artificial intelligence in medicine has shown substantial progress in achieving timely, reliable diagnosis and more precise treatment of many diseases.The expert system developed in this work exhibited a competence of about 92% which has been evaluated by comparing its results with the identification & classification of cervical cells by human experts.

As a result, GroupDNet has a lot of influence over converting semantic labels to natural images and can produce plausible high quality results for datasets with a lot of groups.

Despite the vast amount of research into MCTS, the effect of modifications on the algorithm, as well as the manner in which it performs in various domains, is still not yet fully known. In particular, the effect of using knowledge-heavy rollouts in MCTS still remains poorly understood, with surprising results demonstrating that better-informed rollouts often result in worse-performing agents. We present experimental evidence suggesting that, under certain smoothness conditions, uniformly random simulation policies preserve the ordering over action preferences. This explains the success of MCTS despite its common use of these rollouts to evaluate states. We further analyse non-uniformly random rollout policies and describe conditions under which they offer improved performance.","1674":null,"1675":null,"1677":null,"1678":null,"1680":null,"1681":"In this article, I discuss some recent ideas in complex systems on the topic of networks, contained in or inspired by three recent complex systems books.

A major bottleneck in electronic communications is the enormous dissemination of unwanted, harmful emails known as spam emails . A major concern is the developing of suitable filters that can adequately capture those emails and achieve high performance rate. Machine learning (ML) researchers have developed many approaches in order to tackle this problem. Within the context of machine learning, support vector machines (SVM) have made a large contribution to the development of spam email filtering. Based on SVM, different schemes have been proposed through text classification approaches (TC). A crucial problem when using SVM is the choice of kernels as they directly affect the separation of emails in the feature space. This paper presents thorough investigation of several distance-based kernels and specify spam filtering behaviors using SVM. The majority of used kernels in recent studies concern continuous data and neglect the structure of the text. In contrast to classical kernels, we propose the use of various string kernels for spam filtering. We show how effectively string kernels suit spam filtering problem. On the other hand, data preprocessing is a vital part of text classification where the objective is to generate feature vectors usable by SVM kernels. We detail a feature mapping variants in TC that yield improved performance for the standard SVM in filtering task. Furthermore, to cope for realtime scenarios we propose an online active framework for spam filtering. We present empirical results from an extensive study of online, transductive, and online active methods for classifying spam emails in real time. We show that active online method using string kernels achieves higher precision and recall rates.","1705":null,"1706":null,"1707":null,"1708":null,"1709":null,"1710":null,"1711":null,"1712":null,"1713":null,"1715":null,"1717":null,"1718":"We observe achievement gaps even in rich western countries, such as the UK, which in principle have the resources as well as the social and technical infrastructure to provide a better deal for all learners.

We summarize three existing unit propagation rules and propose a new one based on a nonlinear programming formulation of max-SAT. The second strategy is an effective lower bound based on linear programming (LP). We show that the LP lower bound can be made effective as the number of clauses increases. The third strategy consists of a binary-clause first rule and a dynamic-weighting variable ordering rule, which are motivated by a thorough analysis of two existing well-known variable orderings. Based on the analysis of these strategies, we develop an exact solver for both max-SAT and weighted max-SAT.

Recent experience with DLs, however, has shown that their expressivity is often insufficient to accurately describe structured objects--objects whose parts are interconnected in arbitrary, rather than tree-like ways. DL knowledge bases describing structured objects are therefore usually underconstrained, which precludes the entailment of certain consequences and causes performance problems during reasoning.\r\nTo address this problem, we propose an extension of DL languages with description graphs--a knowledge modeling construct that can accurately describe objects with parts connected in arbitrary ways. Furthermore, to enable modeling the conditional aspects of structured objects, we also extend DLs with rules. We present an in-depth study of the computational properties of such a formalism. In particular, we first identify the sources of undecidability of the general, unrestricted formalism. Based on that analysis, we then investigate several restrictions of the general formalism that make reasoning decidable.

Such guidelines are used in the manual processes of (a) adapting existing documents and (b) producing new materials. The process of adapting existing documents is cyclic and implies three activities: analysis, transformation, and validation. All these activities are human resource consuming, due to the need of involving people with cognitive disabilities as well as E2R experts. In order to alleviate such processes, we are currently investigating the development of methods, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, to perform the analysis and transformation of documents in a (semi)-automatic fashion. In this paper we present our AI-based method for assessing a particular document with respect to the E2R guidelines as well as an initial implementation of such a method; our research on the transformation of documents is out of the scope of this paper. We carried out a comparative evaluation of the results obtained by our initial implementation against the results of the document analysis performed by people with cognitive disabilities.","1741":null,"1742":"Driver assistance technologies that relieve the drivers task, as well as intelligent autonomous vehicles, rely on traffic sign recognition.

One possible solution is to apply a probabilistic model to represent a face simultaneously with its identity variable, which is stable through time, and its aging variable, which changes with time. This paper proposes a deep learning and set based approach to the face recognition subject to aging. The images for each subject taken at various times are treated as a single set, which is then compared to the sets of images belonging to other subjects. Facial features are extracted using a convolutional neural network characteristic of the deep learning. Our experimental results show that set based recognition performs better than the singleton based approach for the both face identification and face verification. We also find that by using set based recognition, it is easier to recognize older subjects from younger ones rather than younger subjects from older ones.

In particular, the article focuses on visual communication about AI and, more specifically, on the use of certain stock images in science communication about AI --- in particular, those characterized by an excessive use of blue color and recurrent subjects, such as androgyne faces, half-flesh and half-circuit brains, and variations on Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. In the first section, the author refers to a ``referentialist'' ethics of science communication for an ethical assessment of these images. From this perspective, these images are unethical. While the ethics of science communication generally promotes virtues like modesty and humility, similar images are arrogant and overconfident. In the second section, the author uses French philosopher Jacques Ranci\u00e8re's concepts of ``distribution of the sensible,'' ``disagreement,'' and ``pensive image.'' Ranci\u00e8re's thought paves the way to a deeper critique of these images of AI. The problem with similar images is not their lack of reference to the ``things themselves.'' It rather lies in the way they stifle any possible forms of disagreement about AI. However, the author argues that stock images and other popular images of AI are not a problem per se, and they can also be a resource. This depends on the real possibility for these images to support forms of pensiveness. In the conclusion, the question is asked whether the kind of ethics or politics of AI images proposed in this article can be applied to AI ethics tout court.","1985":null,"1986":null,"1987":"A general framework for the problem of coordination of multiple competing\n\tgoals in dynamic environments for physical agents is presented.

However, knowledge gained in this field has greatly enhanced our understanding and has enabled us to design human-like intelligent systems. In the 1920s the Gestalt psychologists introduced a new field to cognitive science. They discovered that when presented with certain problems we use insight to reach a solution. In the 1950s Newell and Simon then brought the field of problem solving into the information age. They experimented with the idea of problem solving as a search for a solution in a state space. This technique is today utilized in the field of computing and Artificial Intelligence. This paper reviews techniques and looks at how we use previous experience gained by solving problems to solve new similar problems, making analogies between them.

While AI offers numerous advantages, it also poses significant risks, including ethical dilemmas, bias, privacy concerns, and potential job displacement. This abstract explores the evolving landscape of AI safety and regulations in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic. AI safety encompasses efforts to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, preventing unintended consequences and safeguarding individuals and society at large. In parallel, AI regulations aim to establish a framework that guides the ethical and accountable use of AI technologies. These regulations address data privacy, bias mitigation, transparency, and accountability, among other critical aspects. The advantages of AI safety and regulation are evident in their capacity to protect public health, privacy, and fairness. In healthcare, they ensure the accuracy of diagnostic AI systems and safeguard patient data. In remote work and education, they promote equitable access to AI enhanced services. Additionally, AI safety and regulation play a crucial role in supply chain resilience, mental health support, and the development of digital health records and vaccine passports. However, several limitations and challenges need to be acknowledged. Rapid technological advancements often outpace regulatory frameworks, making it challenging to maintain relevance. Global variations in regulations can create complexities for international cooperation. Overregulation can stifle innovation, while a lack of enforcement can render regulations toothless. The future trends in AI safety and regulation will be shaped by the lessons learned from the COVID 19 pandemic. We anticipate global collaboration and standardization efforts, the proliferation of ethical AI frameworks, and sector specific regulations. Transparent AI, accountability laws, and adaptive regulations will play a significant role in shaping the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. In conclusion, AI safety and regulation are essential components of a post COVID world that seeks to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its potential risks. The responsible development and use of AI technologies are crucial in ensuring a secure, equitable, and ethical digital future.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians.

Rather than suppressing AI-driven tools, educators should foster collaborations among stakeholders, including educators, instructional designers, AI researchers, and developers.

Do students learn from the regular, detailed and personalised feedback provided by AI systems, and will they continue to exhibit similar behaviour in the absence of assistance? Or do they instead continue to rely on AI assistance without learning from it? To contribute to filling this research gap, we conducted a randomised controlled experiment that explored the impact of AI assistance on student agency in the context of peer feedback. With 1625 students across 10 courses, an experiment was conducted using peer review. During the initial four-week period, students were guided by AI features that utilised techniques such as rule-based suggestion detection, semantic similarity, and comparison with previous comments made by the reviewer to enhance their submissions if the feedback provided was deemed insufficiently detailed or general in nature. Over the following four weeks, students were divided into four different groups: control (AI) received prompts, (NR) received no prompts, (SR) received self-monitoring checklists in place of AI prompts, and (SAI) had access to both AI prompts and self-monitoring checklists. Results of the experiment suggest that students tended to rely on rather than learn from AI assistance. If AI assistance was removed, self-regulated strategies could help in filling in the gap but were not as effective as AI assistance. Results also showed that hybrid human-AI approaches that complement AI assistance with self-regulated strategies (SAI) were not more effective than AI assistance on its own.

However, such incidental learning can only occur when people cognitively engage with the information they receive and process this information thoughtfully. How do people process the information and advice they receive from AI, and do they engage with it deeply enough to enable learning? To answer these questions, we conducted three experiments in which individuals were asked to make nutritional decisions and received simulated AI recommendations and explanations. In the first experiment, we found that when people were presented with both a recommendation and an explanation before making their choice, they made better decisions than they did when they received no such help, but they did not learn. In the second experiment, participants first made their own choice, and only then saw a recommendation and an explanation from AI; this condition also resulted in improved decisions, but no learning. However, in our third experiment, participants were presented with just an AI explanation but no recommendation and had to arrive at their own decision. This condition led to both more accurate decisions and learning gains.

In simulations with synthetically generated or context-independent human predictions, delegation can help improve the performance of human-AI teams\u2014compared to humans or the AI model completing the task alone. However, so far, it remains unclear how humans perform and how they perceive the task when they are aware that an AI model delegated task instances to them. In an experimental study with 196 participants, we show that task performance and task satisfaction improve through AI delegation, regardless of whether humans are aware of the delegation. Additionally, we identify humans\u2019 increased levels of self-efficacy as the underlying mechanism for these improvements in performance and satisfaction.

Commonsense knowledge can be viewed as a collection of simple facts about people and everyday life, such as &#034;Things fall down, not up&#034;, and &#034;People eat breakfast in the morning&#034;. One reason that conventional interfaces are stupid and frustrating to use, is that they lack such knowledge.

We applied a mixed methods approach consisting of a moderated study with 40 participants and an unmoderated study with 107 crowd workers using a spreadsheet-like explanation interface based on the SHAP framework. We observed what non-technical users do to form their mental models of global AI model behavior from local explanations and how their perception of understanding decreases when it is examined.","3076":"Perceptions about AI influence the attribution of characteristics and the interaction with AI.

Participants mainly drew humanoid or robotic AIs. The adjectives that describe AI mainly referred to the inner characteristics, capabilities, shape, or relationship types. Regarding the evaluation, we identified four dimensions (warmth, competence, animacy, size) that can be reproduced for male and female AIs and different AI representations.

Simultaneously, considerable critical attention has been given to the implications of AI on gender equality. Far from making precise predictions about the future, this discourse demonstrates that new technologies are instances for renegotiating the relation of gender and work. This paper examines how gender is addressed in news media discourse on AI and the future of work, focusing on Germany. We approach this question from a perspective of feminist technology studies and discourse analysis, exploring a corpus of 178 articles from 2015 to 2021 from German newspapers and newsmagazines. The findings indicate that critical AI and gender knowledge circulates in public discourse in the form of specific discursive frames, thematizing algorithmic bias, automatization and enhancement, and gender stereotypes. As a result, we show that, first, the discourse takes up feminist and scholarly discourse on gender and discusses AI in a way that is informed by social constructivism and standpoint theories. Second, gender appears as a\u2014to some extent intersectional\u2014diversity category which is critical to AI, while at the same time omitting important perspectives. Third, it can be shown that there is a renegotiating of the ideal worker norm taking place, and finally, we argue that the gendered frame of the powerful men developer responsible for AI\u2019s risk is a concept to be challenged.","3082":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is finally bringing a multitude of capabilities to machines that were long thought to belong exclusively to the human realm, such as processing natural language or visual information. In this report, we explain how and where AI could affect the German industrial sector by exploring several questions: Which subindustries are most strongly affected by the automation potential of AI? What are the most promising use cases? What are pragmatic recommendations for managers of industrial players planning to harness the power of AI? Highly developed economies like Germany, with a high GDP per capita and challenges such as a quickly aging population, will increasingly need to rely on automation based on AI to achieve GDP targets. About one-third of Germany\u2019s GDP aspiration for 2030 depends on productivity gains. Automation fueled by AI is one of the most significant sources of productivity. By becoming one of the earliest adopters of AI, Germany could even exceed its 2030 GDP target by 4 percent. However, if the country adopts AI more slowly---and productivity is not increased by any other means---it could lag behind its 2030 GDP target by up to one-third. AI is expected to lift performance across all industries and especially in those with a high share of predictable tasks such as Germany's industrial sector. AI-enabled work could raise productivity in Germany by 0.8 to 1.4 percent annually. We selected eight use cases covering three essential business areas (products and services, manufacturing operations, and business processes) to highlight AI\u2019s great potential in the industrial sector. Use cases include topics such as autonomous vehicles, predictive maintenance, collaborative robotics, and supply-chain management. Five pragmatic recommendations help with getting started on the journey toward a fully AI-enabled organization.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is finally bringing a multitude of capabilities to machines which were long thought to belong exclusively to the human realm: processing natural language or visual information, recognizing patterns, and decision making. While AI undoubtedly holds great economic potential for the whole world, in this report we explain how and where AI will likely affect the German industrial sector by exploring several questions: Which subindustries are most strongly affected by the automation potential of AI? What are the most promising use cases? What are pragmatic recommendations for managers of industrial players planning to harness the power of AI? We describe several use cases in which we highlight the impact of AI and aim to quantify it. These use cases were carefully selected based on their economic potential and their ability to demonstrate the benefits of AI in practice. We do not claim that AI \u2013 despite its enormous potential \u2013 is the silver bullet for every business problem. We realize that AI is very often the enabler for performance improvements whose actual realization requires changing business processes. It is a rapidly evolving field.

The AIAS empowers educators to select the appropriate level of GenAI usage in assessments based on the learning outcomes they seek to address. The AIAS offers greater clarity and transparency for students and educators, provides a fair and equitable policy tool for institutions to work with, and offers a nuanced approach which embraces the opportunities of GenAI while recognising that there are instances where such tools may not be pedagogically appropriate or necessary. By adopting a practical, flexible approach that can be implemented quickly, the AIAS can form a much-needed starting point to address the current uncertainty and anxiety regarding GenAI in education.

Explanations that evoke appropriate trust are even more challenging for decision-making tasks that are difficult for humans and AI. For this reason, we study decision-making by non-experts in the high-uncertainty domain of stock trading. We compare the effectiveness of three different explanation styles (influenced by inductive, abductive, and deductive reasoning) and the role of AI confidence in terms of a) the users\u2019 reliance on the XAI interface elements (charts with indicators, AI prediction, explanation), b) the correctness of the decision (task performance), and c) the agreement with the AI\u2019s prediction. In contrast to previous work, we look at interactions between different aspects of decision-making, including AI correctness, and the combined effects of AI confidence and explanations styles. Our results show that specific explanation styles (abductive and deductive) improve the user\u2019s task performance in the case of high AI confidence compared to inductive explanations. In other words, these styles of explanations were able to invoke correct decisions (for both positive and negative decisions) when the system was certain. In such a condition, the agreement between the user\u2019s decision and the AI prediction confirms this finding, highlighting a significant agreement increase when the AI is correct.

We describe how these traits affect specific knowledge domains (TK, TPK, TCK, XK, and TPACK) and explore implications for educators. Finally, we argue for a more expansive description of Contextual Knowledge (XK), going beyond the immediate context to include considerations of how GenAI will change individuals, society and, through that, the broader educational context.","3116":"We present AI Poincar\u00e9, a machine learning algorithm for auto-discovering\r\nconserved quantities using trajectory data from unknown dynamical systems.

Consequently, these models do not generalize to unseen data, often produce unfair results, and are difficult to interpret. This has led to efforts to improve the trustworthiness aspects of AI models. Recently, causal modeling and inference methods have emerged as powerful tools. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of causal methods that have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of AI models.

During this time, questions of how these programs compared in kind to humans have surfaced and led to beneficial interdisciplinary discussions, but conceptual progress has been slower than technological progress. Within the past decade, the term agency has taken on new import as intelligent agents have become a noticeable part of our everyday lives. Research on autonomous vehicles and personal assistants has expanded into private industry with new and increasingly capable products surfacing as a matter of routine. This wider use of AI technologies has raised questions about legal and moral agency at the highest levels of government (National Science and Technology Council 2016) and drawn the interest of other academic disciplines and the general public. Within this context, the notion of an intelligent agent in AI is too coarse and in need of refinement. We suggest that the space of AI agents can be subdivided into classes, where each class is defined by an associated degree of control.","3131":"Fears of artificial intelligence (ai) have haunted humanity since the very beginning of the computer age.

Algorithms for text classification must be trained and tested with examples of indexed documents, which can be obtained from existing bibliographic databases and digital collections.The National Library of Finland has created Annif, an open source toolkit for automated subject indexing and classification. Annif is multilingual, independent of the indexing vocabulary, and modular. It integrates many text classification algorithms, including Maui, fastText, Omikuji, and a neural network model based on TensorFlow. Best results can often be obtained by combining several algorithms. Many document corpora have been used for training and evaluating Annif. Finding the algorithms and configurations that give the best quality is an ongoing effort.In May 2020, we launched Finto AI, a service for automated subject indexing based on Annif. It provides a simple Web form for obtaining subject suggestions for text. The functionality is also available as a REST API. Many document repositories and the cataloguing system for electronic publications at the National Library of Finland are using it to integrate semi-automated subject indexing into their metadata workflows. In the future, we are going to extend Annif with more algorithms and new functionality, and to integrate Finto AI with other metadata management workflows.","3136":"In recent years, digital object management practices to support findability,\r\naccessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) have begun to be\r\nadopted across a number of data-intensive scientific disciplines.

However, the role of AI assistance in more complex data-labeling scenarios with a larger set of labels has not yet been explored.

Since they strongly interrelate, disentangling these dimensions and their respective impact on collaboration is challenging. To address this issue, we propose various methods for measuring different dimensions of proximity. We then present an approach to compare and rank them with respect to the extent to which they indicate co-publications and co-inventions.

To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.","3211":"The late 1990s saw a huge upswing in the demand for supply chain management software.

Through randomized controlled experiments, we evaluate whether four types of common model-agnostic explainable AI methods satisfy these properties on two types of decision making tasks where people perceive themselves as having different levels of domain expertise in (i.e., recidivism prediction and forest cover prediction). Our results show that the effects of AI explanations are largely different on decision making tasks where people have varying levels of domain expertise in, and many AI explanations do not satisfy any of the desirable properties for tasks that people have little domain expertise in. Further, for decision making tasks that people are more knowledgeable, feature contribution explanation is shown to satisfy more desiderata of AI explanations, while the explanation that is considered to resemble how human explain decisions (i.e., counterfactual explanation) does not seem to improve calibrated trust.

As a result, technical support staff is affected by monotonous work and work overload (Schmidt et al., 2022). Our research aims to augment the precarious workplace of support agents with artificial intelligence (AI). To incorporate an employee-centered perspective a priori and ensure positive impacts, we propose a framework for combining work design theory (e.g. Demerouti et al., 2001) and design science theory (Peffers et al., 2007, Niehaves & Ortbach 2016). The advances in AI promise to leverage large potential in optimizing and enhancing service processes and workplaces (Huang & Rust, 2018, de Keyser, 2019). Introducing AI into service processes, imply effects on work characteristics (Larivi\u00e8re et al., 2017). By combining human and artificial intelligence we propose hybrid intelligence (Dellermann et al., 2019) as a suitable solution for mitigating the persistent issues of support workers and the possible negative impacts of AI. To a great extent, IS research emphasizes the implied impacts of AI use in workplaces (Verma & Singh 2022, Wang et al., 2020).

It was a foundational assumption during the birth of cognitive science as a multidisciplinary field, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) as one of its contributing fields. One conception of AI in this context is as a provider of computational tools (frameworks, concepts, formalisms, models, proofs, simulations, etc.) that support theory building in cognitive science. The contemporary field of AI, however, has taken the theoretical possibility of explaining human cognition as a form of computation to imply the practical feasibility of realising human(-like or -level) cognition in factual computational systems; and, the field frames this realisation as a short-term inevitability. Yet, as we formally prove herein, creating systems with human(-like or -level) cognition is intrinsically computationally intractable. This means that any factual AI systems created in the short-run are at best decoys. When we think these systems capture something deep about ourselves and our thinking, we induce distorted and impoverished images of ourselves and our cognition. In other words, AI in current practice is deteriorating our theoretical understanding of cognition rather than advancing and enhancing it. The situation could be remediated by releasing the grip of the currently dominant view on AI and by returning to the idea of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science.

Yet, little is currently understood about the role of modalities through which explanations can be communicated (e.g., text, visualizations, or audio) to inform, augment, and shape human decision-making. In our work, we address this research gap through the lens of a credibility assessment system. Considering the deluge of information available through various channels, people constantly make decisions while considering the perceived credibility of the information they consume. However, with an increasing information overload, assessing the credibility of the information we encounter is a non-trivial task. To help users in this task, automated credibility assessment systems have been devised as decision support systems in various contexts (e.g., assessing the credibility of news or social media posts). However, for these systems to be effective in supporting users, they need to be trusted and understood. Explanations have been shown to play an essential role in informing users\u2019 reliance on decision support systems. In this paper, we investigate the influence of explanation modalities on an AI-assisted credibility assessment task. We use a between-subjects experiment (N = 375), spanning six different explanation modalities, to evaluate the role of explanation modality on the accuracy of AI-assisted decision outcomes, the perceived system trust among users, and system usability. Our results indicate that explanations play a significant role in shaping users\u2019 reliance on the decision support system and, thereby, the accuracy of decisions made. We found that users performed with higher accuracy while assessing the credibility of statements in the presence of explanations. We also found that users had a significantly harder time agreeing on statement credibility without explanations. With explanations present, text and audio explanations were more effective than graphic explanations. Additionally, we found that combining graphical with text and\/or audio explanations were significantly effective. Such combinations of modalities led to a higher user performance than using graphical explanations alone.","3312":"Reviews the book \"Experience AI: A Practitioner's Guide to Integrating Appreciative Inquiry With Experiential Learning,\" by M.

This paper explores how the narrative of Sagar Manthan can be metaphorically applied to the context of deep sea mining in todays world. By drawing comparisons between the extraction of Amrita nectar of immortality and valuable minerals from the ocean floor, we examine the applications of deep sea mining technologies and the potential rewards it offers in meeting the global demand for critical minerals. Deep sea mining has emerged as a potential solution to meet the ever increasing global demand for valuable metals and minerals. With depleting terrestrial reserves and growing demand for these resources, exploiting the vast mineral wealth lying on the ocean floor has become an attractive proposition. However, the practice of deep sea mining raises significant environmental, economic, and technological challenges.

While the interest in 'machine ethics' has increased rapidly in recent years, there are only very few current efforts in the cognitive systems community to investigate moral and ethical reasoning. And there is currently no cognitive architecture that has even rudimentary moral or ethical competence, i.e., the ability to judge situations based on moral principles such as norms and values and make morally and ethically sound decisions. We hence argue for the urgent need to instill moral and ethical competence in all cognitive system intended to be employed in human social contexts.","3369":"The purpose of this article is to begin the process of engaging the international research community in developing what can be called a standard model of the mind, where the mind we have in mind here is human-like.

However, VAs and according ecosystems face various problems, such as low adoption and satisfaction rates as well as other negative reactions from users. Companies, therefore, need to consider what contributes to user satisfaction of VAs and related conversational AI ecosystems. Key for conversational AI ecosystems is the consideration of trust due to their agentic and pervasive nature. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of conversational AI ecosystems and different trust sources involved, we argue that we need a more detailed understanding about trust. Thus, we propose a configurational view on conversational AI ecosystems that allows us to disentangle the complex and interrelated factors that contribute to trust in VAs. We examine with a configurational approach and a survey study, how different trust sources contribute to the outcomes of conversational AI ecosystems, i.e., in our case user satisfaction. The results of our study show four distinct patterns of trust source configurations. Vice versa, we show how trust sources contribute to the absence of the outcome, i.e., user satisfaction. The derived implications provide a configurative theoretical understanding for the role of trust sources for user satisfaction that provides practitioners useful guidance for more trustworthy conversational AI ecosystems.","3401":"We have conducted a study in a large telecommunication company in Turkey to employ a software measurement program and to predict pre-release defects.

Different research communities have attempted to optimize and evaluate human-AI team performance through empirical studies by increasing transparency of AI systems, or providing explanations to aid human understanding of such systems. However, the variety in decision making tasks considered and their operationalization in prior empirical work, has led to an opacity around how findings from one task or domain carry forward to another. The lack of a standardized means of considering task attributes prevents straightforward comparisons across decision tasks, thereby limiting the generalizability of findings. We argue that the lens of \u2018task complexity\u2019 can be used to tackle this problem of under-specification and facilitate comparison across empirical research in this area. To retrospectively explore how different HCI communities have considered the influence of task complexity in designing experiments in the realm of human-AI decision making, we survey literature and provide an overview of empirical studies on this topic. We found a serious dearth in the consideration of task complexity across various studies in this realm of research. Inspired by Robert Wood\u2019s seminal work on the construct, we operationalized task complexity with respect to three dimensions (component, coordinative, and dynamic) and quantified the complexity of decision tasks in existing work accordingly. We then summarized current trends and proposed research directions for the future. Our study highlights the need to account for task complexity as an important design choice. This is a first step to help the scientific community in drawing meaningful comparisons across empirical studies in human-AI decision making and to provide opportunities to generalize findings across diverse domains and experimental settings.","3451":null,"3452":null,"3456":null,"3457":null,"3461":"This paper presents an integrated system for emotion detection using facial detection and recognition. we have taken into account the fact that emotions are most widely represented with eyes and mouth expressions.

For students and others with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts.

Vapnik himself pointed out this connection, when deriving an actual learning algorithm from this principle, like the well-known support vector machine, but quickly suggested to resort to a Tikhonov regularization schema, instead. This was, at that time, the best choice because the corresponding optimization problem is easier to solve and in any case, under certain hypothesis, the solutions obtained by the two approaches coincide. On the other hand, recent advances in learning theory clearly show that the Ivanov regularization scheme allows a more effective control of the learning hypothesis space and, therefore, of the generalization ability of the selected hypothesis. We prove in this paper the equivalence between the Ivanov and Tikhonov approaches and, for the sake of completeness, their connection to Morozov regularization, which has been show to be useful when effective estimation of the noise in the data is available. We also show that this equivalence is valid under milder conditions on the loss function with respect to Vapnik's original proposal. These results allows us to derive several methods for performing SRM learning according to an Ivanov or Morozov regularization scheme, but using Tikhonov-based solvers, which have been thoroughly studied in the last decades and for which very efficient implementations have been proposed.","5019":"Wir zeigen an Beispieldaten, wie man ein Machine-Learning-Projekt in Python umsetzt.

Classification of genre can be important to clarify some genuine fascinating issues, such as, making songs references, discovering related songs, finding societies who will like that particular song. The inspiration behind the research is to find the appropriate machine learning algorithm that predict the genres of music utilizing k nearest neighbor k NN and Support Vector Machine SVM . GTZAN dataset is the frequently used dataset for the classification music genre. The Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients MFCC is utilized to extricate features for the dataset. From results we found that k NN classifier gave more exact results compared to support vector machine classifier. If the training data is bigger than number of features, k NN gives better outcomes than SVM. SVM can only identify limited set of patterns. KNN classifier is more powerful for the classification of music genre. Seethal V | Dr. A.

In this analysis, 350 microscopic blood smudge images have experimented with six machine learning algorithms for the sort of white blood cells, and their renditions have resembled. Thirty-five distinct geometric and statistical (consistency) features have been pulled from blood pictures for practicum and test parameters of machine learning algorithms. According to the outcomes, the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) algorithm accomplished better than the other techniques, with an average of 95% test victory. The MLR can be utilized for the automatic classification of white blood cells. It can be used mainly as a source for diagnosing diseases for hematologists and internal medicine experts.","5038":"Recently, fake news has been incurring many problems to our society. As a result, many researchers have been working on identifying fake news. Most of the fake news detection systems utilize the linguistic feature of the news. However, they have difficulty in sensing highly ambiguous fake news which can be detected only after identifying meaning and latest related information. In this paper, to resolve this problem, we shall present a new Korean fake news detection system using fact DB which is built and updated by human's direct judgement after collecting obvious facts. Our system receives a proposition, and search the semantically related articles from Fact DB in order to verify whether the given proposition is true or not by comparing the proposition with the related articles in fact DB. To achieve this, we utilize a deep learning model, Bidirectional Multi Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentence BiMPM , which has demonstrated a good performance for the sentence matching task. However, BiMPM has some limitations in that the longer the length of the input sentence is, the lower its performance is, and it has difficulty in making an accurate judgement when an unlearned word or relation between words appear. In order to overcome the limitations, we shall propose a new matching technique which exploits article abstraction as well as entity matching set in addition to BiMPM. In our experiment, we shall show that our system improves the whole performance for fake news detection. Prasanth. K | Praveen. N | Vijay. S | Auxilia Osvin Nancy.

Over the past decade, consumer grade imaging sensors have become increasingly prevalent, generating vast quantities of images and videos that are used for various public and private communication purposes. Such applications include publicity, advocacy, disinformation, and deception, among others. This paper aims to develop tools that can extract knowledge from these visuals and comprehend their provenance. However, many images and videos undergo modification and manipulation before public release, which can misrepresent the facts and deceive viewers. To address this issue, we propose a set of forensics and counter forensic techniques that can help establish the authenticity and integrity of Multimedia content. Additionally, we suggest ways to modify the content intentionally to mislead potential adversaries. Our proposed tools are evaluated using publicly available datasets and independently organized challenges. Our results show that the forensics and counter forensic techniques can accurately identify manipulated content and can help restore the original image or video. Furthermore, in this paper demonstrate that the modified content can successfully deceive potential adversaries while remaining undetected by state of the art forensic methods.

In this\r\npaper, we address this challenge, by proposing SPARCML, a general, scalable\r\ncommunication layer for machine learning applications. SPARCML is built on the\r\nobservation that many distributed machine learning algorithms either have\r\nnaturally sparse communication patters, or have updates which can be sparsified\r\nin a structured way for improved performance, without any convergence or\r\naccuracy loss.

Our\r\ncommunication protocols generalize standard collective operations, by allowing\r\nprocesses to contribute sparse input data vectors, of heterogeneous sizes.

Neurological disorders are the ones that impact the central nervous system (including the human brain) and also include over 600 disorders ranging from brain aneurysm to epilepsy. Every year, based on World Health Organization (WHO), neurological disorders affect much more than one billion people worldwide and count for up to seven million deaths. Hence, useful investigation of neurological disorders is actually of great value. The vast majority of datasets useful for diagnosis of neurological disorders like electroencephalogram (EEG) are actually complicated and poses challenges that are many for data mining and machine learning algorithms due to their increased dimensionality, non stationarity, and non linearity. Hence, an better feature representation is actually key to an effective suite of data mining and machine learning algorithms in the examination of neurological disorders. With this exploration, we use a well defined EEG dataset to train as well as test out models. A preprocessing stage is actually used to extend, arrange and manipulate the framework of free data sets to the needs of ours for better training and tests results. Several techniques are used by us to enhance system accuracy. This particular paper concentrates on dealing with above pointed out difficulties and appropriately analyzes different EEG signals that would in turn help us to boost the procedure of feature extraction and enhance the accuracy in classification.

This paper presents a solution which has been guided by psychological and mathematical results. The method is based on a distributed concept description which is composed of a set of weighted, symbolic characterizations. Two learning processes incrementally modify this description. One adjusts the characterization weights and another creates new characterizations. The latter process is described in terms of a search through the space of possibilities and is shown to require linear space with respect to the number of attribute-value pairs in the description language.

Recently however, it has been shown that this requirement might be too stringent, leading to a substantial number of missed target sites.RESULTS:We developed TargetSpy, a novel computational approach for predicting target sites regardless of the presence of a seed match. It is based on machine learning and automatic feature selection using a wide spectrum of features covering current biological knowledge. Our model does not rely on evolutionary conservation, which allows for the detection of species-specific interactions and makes TargetSpy suitable for analyzing unconserved genomic sequences. \r\nIn order to allow for an unbiased comparison of TargetSpy to other methods, we classified all algorithms into three groups: I) no seed match requirement, II) seed match requirement, and III) conserved seed match requirement. TargetSpy predictions for classes II and III are generated by appropriate postfiltering. On a human dataset revealing fold-change in protein production for five selected microRNAs our method shows superior performance in all classes. In Drosophila melanogaster not only our class II and III predictions are on par with other algorithms, but notably the class I (no-seed) predictions are just marginally less acurate.  We estimate that TargetSpy predicts between 26 and 112 functional target sites without a seed match per microRNA that are missed by all other currently available algorithms. CONCLUSION:Only a few algorithms can predict target sites without demanding a seed match and TargetSpy demonstrates a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy in that class. Furthermore, when conservation and the presence of a seed match are required, the performance is comparable with state-of-the-art algorithms. TargetSpy was trained on mouse and performs well in human and drosophila, suggesting that it may be applicable to a broad range of species. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the application of machine learning techniques in combination with upcoming deep sequencing data results in a powerful microRNA target site prediction tool (www.targetspy.org).","5212":"Machine learning for therapeutics is an emerging field with incredible\r\nopportunities for innovation and expansion.

These include in particular genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, devoted respectively to the examination of the entire systems of genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites present in a given cell or tissue type. The availability of these new, highly effective tools for biological exploration is dramatically changing the way one performs research in at least two respects. First, the amount of available experimental data is not a limiting factor any more; on the contrary, there is a plethora of it. Given the research question, the challenge has shifted towards identifying the relevant pieces of information and making sense out of it (a \u2019data mining\u2019 issue). Second, rather than focus on components in isolation, we can now try to understand how biological systems behave as a result of the integration and interaction between the individual components that one can now monitor simultaneously, so called \u2019systems biology\u2019. Machine learning naturally appears as one of the main drivers of progress in this context, where most of the targets of interest deal with complex structured objects: sequences, 2D and 3D structures or interaction networks. At the same time bioinformatics and systems biology have already induced significant new developments of general interest in machine learning, for example in the context of learning with structured data, graph inference, semi- supervised learning, system identification, and novel combinations of optimization and learning algorithms.

The workshop was organized as a core event of the PASCAL2 Network of Excellence, under the IST programme of European Union. The aim of the workshop was to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research in machine learning methods and their applications to systems biology (i.e., complex biological and medical questions) by bringing together method developers and experimentalists. The technical program of the workshop consisted of invited lectures, oral presentations and poster presentations. Invited lectures were given by Diego di Bernardo, Roman Jerala, Nick Juty, Yannis Kalaidzidis, Ross D. King, and William Stafford Noble. Twelve oral presentations were given, for which extended abstracts (papers) are included in this book: these were selected from 18 submissions, each reviewed by three members of the scientific program committee. Twenty-two poster presentations were given, for which one-page abstracts are included here. We would like to thank all the people contributing to the technical programme, the scientific program committee, the local organizers and the sponsors for making the workshop possible.

However, representation of the wildfire-climate relationship remains challenging, due to spatiotemporally heterogenous responses of wildfires to climate variability and human influences. Here, we developed an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) fire model (AttentionFire_v1.0) to resolve the complex spatial- heterogenous and time-lagged controls from climate on burned area and to better predict burned areas over ASA regions. Our ML fire model substantially improved predictability of burned area for both spatial and temporal dynamics compared with five commonly used machine learning models. More importantly, the model revealed strong time-lagged control from climate wetness on the burned areas. The model also predicted that under a high emission future climate scenario, the recently observed declines in burned area will reverse in South America in the near future due to climate changes. Our study provides reliable and interpretable fire model and highlights the importance of lagged wildfire-climate relationships in historical and future predictions.","5223":"Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of modern\r\nresearch and application.

After decades of research little is known about its mechanisms. Having prognostic estimates about dementia can help researchers, patients and public entities in dealing with this disorder. Thus, health data, machine learning and microsimulation techniques could be employed in developing prognostic estimates for dementia.The goal of this paper is to present evidence on the state of the art of studies investigating and the prognosis of dementia using machine learning and microsimulation techniques.To achieve our goal we carried out a systematic literature review, in which three large databases-Pubmed, Socups and Web of Science were searched to select studies that employed machine learning or microsimulation techniques for the prognosis of dementia. A single backward snowballing was done to identify further studies. A quality checklist was also employed to assess the quality of the evidence presented by the selected studies, and low quality studies were removed. Finally, data from the final set of studies were extracted in summary tables.In total 37 papers were included. The data summary results showed that the current research is focused on the investigation of the patients with mild cognitive impairment that will evolve to Alzheimer's disease, using machine learning techniques. Microsimulation studies were concerned with cost estimation and had a populational focus. Neuroimaging was the most commonly used variable.Prediction of conversion from MCI to AD is the dominant theme in the selected studies. Most studies used ML techniques on Neuroimaging data. Only a few data sources have been recruited by most studies and the ADNI database is the one most commonly used.

DNA from tumors of 37 patients (21 squamous carcinomas, and 16 adenocarcinomas) were extracted and hybridized onto a 452 BAC clone array.

We assume that domain-general knowledge is a significant factor in handling data-scarce domains.

However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, phenocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules.We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean\u2009=\u20090.77, 95% quantile\u2009=\u20090.53 - 0.95) over 50 random initializations.

We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifier's NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples.We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine.","5272":"The linear matter power spectrum $P(k,z)$ connects theory with large scale\r\nstructure observations in cosmology.

The suggested system will combine data from the repository and the meteorological department to make a prediction of the most suited crops based on current environmental conditions using a machine learning method called Multiple Linear Regression. This gives a farmer a wide range of crops to choose from.

The model has been evaluated to asses its capacity to generalize over different syntactic structures, tolerate unknown words, and improve its performance by enriching the training set with new annotated examples. The results obtained in our evaluation show how approaching the ontology learning problem as a neural machine translation task can be a valid way to tackle long term expressive ontology learning challenges such as language variability, domain independence, and high engineering costs.","5307":null,"5308":"We investigated the effects of example-based explanations for a machine learning classifier on end users' appropriate trust. We explored the effects of spatial layout and visual representation in an in-person user study with 33 participants. We measured participants' appropriate trust in the classifier, quantified the effects of different spatial layouts and visual representations, and observed changes in users' trust over time. The results show that each explanation improved users' trust in the classifier, and the combination of explanation, human, and classification algorithm yielded much better decisions than the human and classification algorithm separately. Yet these visual explanations lead to different levels of trust and may cause inappropriate trust if an explanation is difficult to understand. Visual representation and performance feedback strongly affect users' trust, and spatial layout shows a moderate effect. Our results do not support that individual differences (e.g., propensity to trust) affect users' trust in the classifier. This work advances the state-of-the-art in trust-able machine learning and informs the design and appropriate use of automated systems.","5309":null,"5310":null,"5311":"Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfield of AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focuses on the information management aspects of systems with several components working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behavior management in collections of several independent entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to the field and as an organizational framework. A series of general multiagent scenarios are presented. For each scenario, the issues that arise are described along with a sampling of the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presented techniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagent systems can be and have been used to build complex systems. When options exist, the techniques presented are biased towards machine learning approaches. Additional opportunities for applying machine learning to MAS are highlighted and robotic soccer is presented as an appropriate test bed for MAS. This survey does not focus exclusively on robotic systems. However, we believe that much of the prior research in non-robotic MAS is relevant to robotic MAS, and we explicitly discuss several robotic MAS, including all of those presented in this issue.","5312":null,"5313":null,"5314":null,"5315":"Tapping into the \"folk knowledge\" needed to advance machine learning applications.","5316":null,"5317":null,"5318":"In many learning problems prior knowledge about pattern variations can be formalized and beneficially incorporated into the analysis system.

Additionally, the fundamental relation of invariant kernels and traditional invariant pattern analysis by means of invariant representations will be clarified. After addressing these conceptional questions, we focus on practical aspects and present two generic approaches for constructing invariant kernels. The first approach is based on a technique called invariant integration. The second approach builds on invariant distances. In principle, our approaches support general transformations in particular covering discrete and non-group or even an infinite number of pattern-transformations. Additionally, both enable a smooth interpolation between invariant and non-invariant pattern analysis, i.e. they are a covering general framework.

The fully automatic author disambiguation approach could not give satisfactory results due to the lack of signals in many cases. Furthermore, human judgment on the basis of automatic algorithms is also not suitable because the automatically disambiguated results are often mixed and not understandable for humans. In this paper, we propose a Labeling Oriented Author Disambiguation approach, called LOAD, to combine machine learning and human judgment together in author disambiguation. LOAD exploits a framework which consists of high precision clustering, high recall clustering, and top dissimilar clusters selection and ranking. In the framework, supervised learning algorithms are used to train the similarity functions between publications and a clustering algorithm is further applied to generate clusters. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed LOAD approach, comprehensive experiments are conducted. Comparing to conventional author disambiguation algorithms, the LOAD yields much more accurate results to assist human labeling. Further experiments show that the LOAD approach can save labeling time dramatically.","5325":"In software engineering, the main aim is to develop projects that produce the desired results within limited schedule and budget. The most important factor affecting the budget of a project is the effort. Therefore, estimating effort is crucial because hiring people more than needed leads to a loss of income and hiring people less than needed leads to an extension of schedule. The main objective of this research is making an analysis of software effort estimation to overcome problems related to it: budget and schedule extension. To accomplish this, we propose a model that uses machine learning methods. We evaluate these models on public datasets and data gathered from software organizations in Turkey. It is found out in the experiments that the best method for a dataset may change and this proves the point that the usage of one model cannot always produce the best results.","5326":"We present an automated method for measuring media bias.

Today, spam blogs (splogs) became one of major issues on theWeb. The problem of splogs is that values of blog sites are different by people. We propose a novel user-oriented splog filtering method that can adapt each user's preference for valuable blogs. We use the SVM(Support Vector Machine) for creating a personalized splog filter for each user. We had two experiments: (1) an experiment of individual splog judgement, and (2) an experiment for user oriented splog filtering. From the former experiment, we found existence of 'gray' blogs that are needed to treat by persons. From the latter experiment, we found that we can provide appropriate personalized filters by choosing the best feature set for each user. An overview of proposed method, and evaluation results are described.","5330":"Machine learning techniques offer promise to improve suicide risk prediction. In the current systematic review, we aimed to review the existing literature on the application of machine learning techniques to predict self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs).We systematically searched PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, ERIC, CINAHL, and MEDLINE for articles published through February 2018.Thirty-five articles met criteria to be included in the review. Included articles were reviewed by outcome: suicide death, suicide attempt, suicide plan, suicidal ideation, suicide risk, and non-suicidal self-injury. We observed three general aims in the use of SITB-focused machine learning analyses: (1) improving prediction accuracy, (2) identifying important model indicators (i.e., variable selection) and indicator interactions, and (3) modeling underlying subgroups. For studies with the aim of boosting predictive accuracy, we observed greater prediction accuracy of SITBs than in previous studies using traditional statistical methods. Studies using machine learning for variable selection purposes have both replicated findings of well-known SITB risk factors and identified novel variables that may augment model performance. Finally, some of these studies have allowed for subgroup identification, which in turn has helped to inform clinical cutoffs.Limitations of the current review include relatively low paper sample size, inconsistent reporting procedures resulting in an inability to compare model accuracy across studies, and lack of model validation on external samples.We concluded that leveraging machine learning techniques to further predictive accuracy and identify novel indicators will aid in the prediction and prevention of suicide.","5331":"Even todays most advanced machine learning models are easily fooled by almost\r\nimperceptible perturbations of their inputs.

This becomes particularly challenging when data changes over time and fresh models need to be produced continuously. Unfortunately, such orchestration is often done ad hoc using glue code and custom scripts developed by individual teams for specific use cases, leading to duplicated effort and fragile systems with high technical debt. We present TensorFlow Extended (TFX), a TensorFlow-based general-purpose machine learning platform implemented at Google. By integrating the aforementioned components into one platform, we were able to standardize the components, simplify the platform configuration, and reduce the time to production from the order of months to weeks, while providing platform stability that minimizes disruptions. We present the case study of one deployment of TFX in the Google Play app store, where the machine learning models are refreshed continuously as new data arrive.

The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.","5355":"Machine learning is often used to build predictive models by extracting patterns from large datasets.

How can ML computation be bridged with inter-machine communication? How can such communication be performed? What should be communicated between machines? By exposing underlying statistical and algorithmic characteristics unique to ML programs but not typically seen in traditional computer programs, and by dissecting successful cases to reveal how we have harnessed these principles to design and develop both high-performance distributed ML software as well as general-purpose ML frameworks, we present opportunities for ML researchers and practitioners to further shape and enlarge the area that lies between ML and systems.","5361":"Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is one of today\u2019s most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.","5363":"The last decade has seen considerable growth in interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In the broadest sense, these fields aim to \u2018learn something useful\u2019 about the environment within which the organism operates. How gathered information is processed leads to the development of algorithms \u2013 how to process high dimensional data and deal with uncertainty. In the early stages of research in Machine Learning and related areas, similar techniques were discovered in relatively isolated research communities. Whilst not all techniques have a natural description in terms of probability theory, many do, and it is the framework of Graphical Models (a marriage between graph and probability theory) that has enabled the understanding and transference of ideas from statistical physics, statistics, machine learning and information theory. To this extent it is now reasonable to expect that machine learning researchers are familiar with the basics of statistical modelling techniques.\r\n\r\nThis book concentrates on the probabilistic aspects of information processing and machine learning. Certainly no claim is made as to the correctness or that this is the only useful approach. Indeed, one might counter that this is unnecessary since \u201cbiological organisms don\u2019t use probability theory\u201d. Whether this is the case or not, it is undeniable that the framework of graphical models and probability has helped with the explosion of new algorithms and models in the machine learning community. One should also be clear that Bayesian viewpoint is not the only way to go about describing machine learning and information processing. Bayesian and probabilistic techniques really come into their own in domains where uncertainty is a necessary consideration.","5364":null,"5365":"Good benchmarks are hard to find because they require a substantial effort to keep them representative for the constantly changing challenges of a particular field.

We re-evaluate CLgen by comparing the benchmarks generated by the model with the raw data used to train it.

The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model\r\nshould balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express\r\nunderlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns.\r\nHowever, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are\r\ntrained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data.

There is an urgent need for automatic system to treat code smells. Tools provide variable results, based on threshold values and subjective interpretation of smells.

Practitioners do not need expert knowledge on smell's characteristics for detection, which makes this approach accessible. In this paper, we have implemented 32 machine learning algorithms after performing feature selection through six variations of the filter method. We have used multiple correlation methodologies to discard similar features. Mutual information, fisher score, and univariate ROC--AUC feature selection techniques were used with brute force and random forest correlation strategies. Feature selection eliminates dimensionality curse and improves performance measures drastically. It is the selection of relevant feature subset based on the relation between dependent and independent variables. We have compared performance of classifiers implemented with and without performing feature selection. Results show that accuracy of machine learning models has increased up to 26.5\\%, f-measure by 70.9\\%, area under ROC curve has surged up to 26.74\\%, and average training time has reduced up to 62 s as compared to performance measures of machine learning models executed without feature selection.

Data was collected from Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospitals NAUTH and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital LASUTH for patients between the ages of 28 87years suffering from peripheral neuropathy. Other methods used were data integration by applying uniform data access UDA technique, data processing using Infinite Impulse Response Filter IIRF , data extraction with a computerized approach, machine learning algorithm with Dynamic Feed Forward Neural Network DFNN , rule base algorithm. The modeling of the hybrid dynamic expert system and remedies was achieved using the DFNN for the detection of DPN and a rule based model for remedies and recommendations. The models were implemented with MATLAB and Java programming languages. The result when evaluated achieved a Mean Square Error MSE of 4.9392e 11 and Regression R of 0.99823. The implication of the result showed that the peripheral diabetes detection model correctly learns the peripheral diabetes attributes and was also able to correctly detect peripheral diabetes in patients. The model when compared with other sophisticated models also showed that it achieved a better regression score. The reason was due to the appropriate steps used in the data preparation such as integration and the use of IIFR filter, feature extraction, and the deep configuration of the regression model.

Very few\r\nprevious studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting\r\nproblem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate\r\nprecipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in\r\nwhich both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By\r\nextending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures\r\nin both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the\r\nconvolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model\r\nfor the precipitation nowcasting problem.

We describe the use of a naive Bayesian classifier for this task, and demonstrate that it can incrementally learn profiles from user feedback on the interestingness of Web sites. Furthermore, the Bayesian classifier may easily be extended to revise user provided profiles. In an experimental evaluation we compare the Bayesian classifier to computationally more intensive alternatives, and show that it performs at least as well as these approaches throughout a range of different domains. In addition, we empirically analyze the effects of providing the classifier with background knowledge in form of user defined profiles and examine the use of lexical knowledge for feature selection. We find that both approaches can substantially increase the prediction accuracy.","5417":"Prognostic modelling is important in clinical practice and epidemiology for patient management and research. Electronic health records (EHR) provide large quantities of data for such models, but conventional epidemiological approaches require significant researcher time to implement. Expert selection of variables, fine-tuning of variable transformations and interactions, and imputing missing values are time-consuming and could bias subsequent analysis, particularly given that missingness in EHR is both high, and may carry meaning. Using a cohort of 80,000 patients from the CALIBER programme, we compared traditional modelling and machine-learning approaches in EHR. First, we used Cox models and random survival forests with and without imputation on 27 expert-selected, preprocessed variables to predict all-cause mortality. We then used Cox models, random forests and elastic net regression on an extended dataset with 586 variables to build prognostic models and identify novel prognostic factors without prior expert input. We observed that data-driven models used on an extended dataset can outperform conventional models for prognosis, without data preprocessing or imputing missing values. An elastic net Cox regression based with 586 unimputed variables with continuous values discretised achieved a C-index of 0.801 (bootstrapped 95% CI 0.799 to 0.802), compared to 0.793 (0.791 to 0.794) for a traditional Cox model comprising 27 expert-selected variables with imputation for missing values. We also found that data-driven models allow identification of novel prognostic variables; that the absence of values for particular variables carries meaning, and can have significant implications for prognosis; and that variables often have a nonlinear association with mortality, which discretised Cox models and random forests can elucidate. This demonstrates that machine-learning approaches applied to raw EHR data can be used to build models for use in research and clinical practice, and identify novel predictive variables and their effects to inform future research.","5418":null,"5419":"Abstract.Coronary Artery Disease is the type of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that happens whenthe  blood  vessels  which  stream  the  blood  toward  the  heart,  either  become  tapered  or  blocked.

The Semantic Web provides standardized formats for the representation of both data and ontological background knowledge. Semantic Web standards are used to describe meta data but also have great potential as a general data format for data communication and data integration. Within a broad range of possible applications machine learning will play an increasingly important role: Machine learning solutions have been developed to support the management of ontologies, for the semi-automatic annotation of unstructured data, and to integrate semantic information into web mining. Machine learning will increasingly be employed to analyze distributed data sources described in Semantic Web formats and to support approximate Semantic Web reasoning and querying. In this paper we discuss existing and future applications of machine learning on the Semantic Web with a strong focus on learning algorithms that are suitable for the relational character of the Semantic Web's data structure. We discuss some of the particular aspects of learning that we expect will be of relevance for the Semantic Web such as scalability, missing and contradicting data, and the potential to integrate ontological background knowledge.

We allow at the final layer transfer functions such as the softmax function that need to consider the linear activations to all the output neurons. The weight vectors used to produce the linear activations are represented indirectly by maintaining separate parameter vectors. We get the weight vector by applying a particular parameterization function to the parameter vector. Updating the parameter vectors upon seeing new examples is done additively, as in the usual gradient descent update. However, by using a nonlinear parameterization function between the parameter vectors and the weight vectors, we can make the resulting update of the weight vector quite different from a true gradient descent update. To analyse such updates, we define a notion of a matching loss function and apply it both to the transfer function and to the parameterization function. The loss function that matches the transfer function is used to measure the goodness of the predictions of the algorithm. The loss function that matches the parameterization function can be used both as a measure of divergence between models in motivating the update rule of the algorithm and as a measure of progress in analyzing its relative performance compared to an arbitrary fixed model. As a result, we have a unified treatment that generalizes earlier results for the gradient descent and exponentiated gradient algorithms to multidimensional outputs, including multiclass logistic regression.","5445":"This paper presents a series of feminist epistemological concepts as tools for developing critical, more accountable, and contextualised approaches to machine learning systems design.

Over a period of time, they have become very common and are now overstretching the healthcare systems of countries. The major factors of cardiovascular diseases are high blood pressure, family history, stress, age, gender, cholesterol, Body Mass Index (BMI), and unhealthy lifestyle. Based on these factors, researchers have proposed various approaches for early diagnosis. However, the accuracy of proposed techniques and approaches needs certain improvements due to the inherent criticality and life threatening risks of cardiovascular diseases. In this article, a MaLCaDD (Machine Learning based Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis) framework is proposed for the effective prediction of cardiovascular diseases with high precision. Particularly, the framework first deals with the missing values (via mean replacement technique) and data imbalance (via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique - SMOTE). Subsequently, Feature Importance technique is utilized for feature selection. Finally, an ensemble of Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers is proposed for prediction with higher accuracy. The validation of framework is performed through three benchmark datasets (i.e. Framingham, Heart Disease and Cleveland) and the accuracies of 99.1%, 98.0% and 95.5 % are achieved respectively. Finally, the comparative analysis proves that MaLCaDD predictions are more accurate (with reduced set of features) as compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, MaLCaDD is highly reliable and can be applied in real environment for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.","5452":"This thesis examines the use of machine learning techniques in various tasks of natural language processing, mainly for the task of information extraction from texts.

In this paper, we present a web-based platform MFlux (http:\/\/mflux.org) that predicts the bacterial central metabolism via machine learning, leveraging data from approximately 100 13C-MFA papers on heterotrophic bacterial metabolisms. Three machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Tree, were employed to study the sophisticated relationship between influential factors and metabolic fluxes. We performed a grid search of the best parameter set for each algorithm and verified their performance through 10-fold cross validations. SVM yields the highest accuracy among all three algorithms. Further, we employed quadratic programming to adjust flux profiles to satisfy stoichiometric constraints. Multiple case studies have shown that MFlux can reasonably predict fluxomes as a function of bacterial species, substrate types, growth rate, oxygen conditions, and cultivation methods. Due to the interest of studying model organism under particular carbon sources, bias of fluxome in the dataset may limit the applicability of machine learning models. This problem can be resolved after more papers on 13C-MFA are published for non-model species.","5455":"The traditional means of extracting information from the Web are keyword-based search and browsing. The Semantic Web adds structured information (i.e., semantic annotations and references) supporting both activities. One of the most interesting recent developments is Linked Open Data (LOD), where information is presented in the form of facts -- often originating from published domain-specific databases -- that can be accessed both by a human and a machine via specific query endpoints. In this article, we argue that machine learning provides a new way to query web data, in particular LOD, by analyzing and exploiting statistical regularities. We discuss challenges when applying machine learning to the Web and discuss the particular learning approaches we have been pursuing in THESEUS. We discuss a number of applications where the Web is queried via machine learning and describe several extensions to our approaches.","5456":null,"5457":"To assess the exposure of citizens to pollutants like NOx or particulate matter in urban areas, land use regression (LUR) models are a well established method. LUR models leverage information about environmental and anthropogenic factors such as cars, heating, or industry to predict air pollution in areas where no measurements have been made. However, existing approaches are often not globally applicable and require tedious hyper-parameter tuning to enable high quality predictions. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing OpenLUR, an off-the-shelf approach for modeling air pollution that (i) works on a set of novel features solely extracted from the globally and openly available data source OpenStreetMap and (ii) is based on state-of-the-art machine learning featuring automated hyper-parameter tuning in order to minimize manual effort. We show that our proposed features are able to outperform their counterparts from local and closed sources, and illustrate how automated hyper parameter tuning can yield competitve results while alleviating the need for expert knowledge in machine learning and manual effort. Importantly, we further demonstrate the potential of the global availability of our features by applying cross-learning across different cities in order to reduce the need for a large amount of training samples. Overall, OpenLUR represents an off-the-shelf approach that facilitates easily reproducible experiments and the development of globally applicable models.","5458":"This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint.

Although the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) represents an impressive effort for the systematic evaluation of OM systems, it still suffers from several limitations including limited evaluation of subsumption mappings, suboptimal reference mappings, and limited support for the evaluation of ML-based systems. To tackle these limitations, we introduce five new biomedical OM tasks involving ontologies extracted from Mondo and UMLS. Each task includes both equivalence and subsumption matching; the quality of reference mappings is ensured by human curation, ontology pruning, etc.; and a comprehensive evaluation framework is proposed to measure OM performance from various perspectives for both ML-based and non-ML-based OM systems. We report evaluation results for OM systems of different types to demonstrate the usage of these resources, all of which are publicly available as part of the new Bio-ML track at OAEI 2022.","5460":"Specifically designed for non-mathematicians, this useful guide presents a breakdown of each variant of machine learning, with examples and working code.

Risk prediction models are widely used in insurance companies and health services. However, the use of these models to allow an early detection of social exclusion by social workers is not a common practice. This paper describes a data analysis of over 16K cases with over 60 predictors from the Spanish region of Castilla y Le\u00f3n. The use of machine learning paradigms such as logistic regression and random forest makes possible a high precision in predicting chronic social exclusion. The paper is complemented with a responsive web available online that allows social workers to calculate the risk of a social exclusion case to become chronic through a smartphone.","5462":"The topic of this monograph falls within the, so-called, biologically motivated computing paradigm, in which biology provides the source of models and inspiration towards the development of computational intelligence and machine learning systems. Specifically, artificial immune systems are presented as a valid metaphor towards the creation of abstract and high level representations of biological components or functions that lay the foundations for an alternative machine learning paradigm. Therefore, focus is given on addressing the primary problems of Pattern Recognition by developing Artificial Immune System-based machine learning algorithms for the problems of Clustering, Classification and One-Class Classification. Pattern Classification, in particular, is studied within the context of the Class Imbalance Problem. The main source of inspiration stems from the fact that the Adaptive Immune System constitutes one of the most sophisticated biological systems that is exceptionally evolved in order to continuously address an extremely unbalanced pattern classification problem, namely, the self \/ non-self discrimination process. The experimental results presented in this monograph involve a wide range of degenerate binary classification problems where the minority class of interest is to be recognized against the vast volume of the majority class of negative patterns. In this context, Artificial Immune Systems are utilized for the development of personalized software as the core mechanism behind the implementation of Recommender Systems.","5463":"Cancer analysis and prediction is the utmost important research field for\r\nwell-being of humankind.

This is usually determined from an optical spectrum giving the\r\nsource redshift. However, not only will this be impractical for the large\r\nnumber of sources expected to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array, but\r\nbright optical sources are the most ultra-violet luminous at high redshift and\r\nso bias against the detection of cool, neutral gas.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.","5472":"Beta Basis Function Neural Network (BBFNN) is a special kind of kernel basis\r\nneural networks.

This scenario leads to an extra coding-effort to achieve both the desired interoperability and a better provenance level as well as a more automatized environment for obtaining the generated results. Hence, when using ML libraries, it is a common task to re-design specific data models (schemata) and develop wrappers to manage the produced outputs. In this article, we discuss this gap focusing on the solution for the question: ``What is the cleanest and lowest-impact solution to achieve both higher interoperability and provenance metadata levels in the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) context and how to facilitate the inherent data querying task?''. We introduce a novel and low impact methodology specifically designed for code built in that context, combining semantic web concepts and reflection in order to minimize the gap for exporting ML metadata in a structured manner, allowing embedded code annotations that are, in run-time, converted in one of the state-of-the-art ML schemas for the Semantic Web: the MEX Vocabulary.","5482":"Data mining techniques are used to power intelligent software, both on and off the Internet. <I>Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools<\/I> explains the magic behind information extraction in a book that succeeds at bringing the latest in computer science research to any IS manager or developer.

In this context, we argue here for the usefulness of constructing communities of users with common behaviour, making use of machine learning techniques. In particular, we assume that the users of any service on the Internet constitute a large community and we aim to construct smaller communities of users with common characteristics. The paper presents the results of three case studies for three different types of Internet service: a digital library, an information broker and a Web site. Particular attention is paid on the different types of information access involved in the three case studies: query-based information retrieval, profile-based information filtering and Web-site navigation. Each type of access imposes different constraints on the representation of the learning task. Two different unsupervised learning methods are evaluated: conceptual clustering and cluster mining. One of our main concerns is the construction of meaningful communities that can be used for improving information access on the Internet. Analysis of the results in the three case studies brings to surface some of the important properties of the task, suggesting the feasibility of a common methodology for the three different types of information access on the Internet.","5487":"The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques.

We suggest that, to survive in their environments, animats must in effect learn multiple disjunctive concepts incrementally under payoff (needs-satisfying) feedback. A review of machine learning techniques indicates that most relax at least one of these constraints. In theory, classifier systems satisfy the constraints, but tests have been limited. We show how the standard classifier system model applies to the animat learning problem. Then, in the experimental part of the paper, we specialize the model and test it in a problem environment satisfying the constraints and consisting of a difficult, disjunctive Boolean function drawn from the machine learning literature. Results include: learning the function in significantly fewer trials than a neural-network method; learning under payoff regimes that include both noisy payoff and partial reward for suboptimal performance; demonstration, in a classifier system, of a theoretically predicted property of genetic algorithms: the superiority of crossovers to point mutations; and automatic control of variation (search) rate based on system entropy. We conclude that the results support the classifier system approach to the animat problem, but suggest work aimed at the emergence of behavioral hierarchies of classifiers to offset slower learning rates in larger problems.","5505":"Reflective writing is an important educational practice to train reflective thinking.

To test this hypothesis, we generated a chemical-genetic matrix of 195 diverse yeast deletion strains treated with 4,915 compounds. This approach uncovered 1,221 genotype-specific inhibitors, which we termed cryptagens. Synergism between 8,128 structurally disparate cryptagen pairs was assessed experimentally and used to benchmark predictive algorithms. A model based on the chemical-genetic matrix and the genetic interaction network failed to accurately predict synergism. However, a combined random forest and Naive Bayesian learner that associated chemical structural features with genotype-specific growth inhibition had strong predictive power. This approach identified previously unknown compound combinations that exhibited species-selective toxicity toward human fungal pathogens.

These modeling techniques are flexible enough to handle complex problems with multiple interacting elements and typically outcompete traditional approaches (e.g., generalized linear models), making them ideal for modeling ecological systems. Despite their inherent advantages, a review of the literature reveals only a modest use of these approaches in ecology as compared to other disciplines. One potential explanation for this lack of interest is that machine learning techniques do not fall neatly into the class of statistical modeling approaches with which most ecologists are familiar. In this paper, we provide an introduction to three machine learning approaches that can be broadly used by ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation. For each approach, we provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, explore the availability of statistical software, and provide an illustrative example. Although the ecological application of machine learning approaches has increased, there remains considerable skepticism with respect to the role of these techniques in ecology. Our review encourages a greater understanding of machin learning approaches and promotes their future application and utilization, while also providing a basis from which ecologists can make informed decisions about whether to select or avoid these approaches in their future modeling endeavors.","5568":"Although a large body of work is devoted to finding communities in static social networks, only a few studies examined the dynamics of communities in evolving social networks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic stochastic block model for finding communities and their evolution in a dynamic social network. The proposed model captures the evolution of communities by explicitly modeling the transition of community memberships for individual nodes in the network. Unlike many existing approaches for modeling social networks that estimate parameters by their most likely values (i.e., point estimation), in this study, we employ a Bayesian treatment for parameter estimation that computes the posterior distributions for all the unknown parameters. This Bayesian treatment allows us to capture the uncertainty in parameter values and therefore is more robust to data noise than point estimation. In addition, an efficient algorithm is developed for Bayesian inference to handle large sparse social networks. Extensive experimental studies based on both synthetic data and real-life data demonstrate that our model achieves higher accuracy and reveals more insights in the data than several state-of-the-art algorithms.","5569":null,"5570":null,"5571":null,"5572":"Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are a key component of neuronal signaling and fulfil different roles depending on their composition. In electron micrograms of neurites, two types of vesicles can be distinguished by morphological criteria, the classical \u201cclear core\u201d vesicles (CCV) and the typically larger \u201cdense core\u201d vesicles (DCV), with differences in electron density due to their diverse cargos. Compared to CCVs, the precise function of DCVs is less defined. DCVs are known to store neuropeptides, which function as neuronal messengers and modulators 1. In C. elegans, they play a role in locomotion, dauer formation, egg-laying, and mechano- and chemosensation 2. Another type of DCVs, also referred to as granulated vesicles, are known to transport Bassoon, Piccolo and further constituents of the presynaptic density in the center of the active zone (AZ), and therefore are important for synaptogenesis 3. To better understand the role of different types of SVs, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, the ImageJ macro 3D ART VeSElecT. With that we reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs in electron tomograms of C. elegans NMJs using image-based features. Analysis of the underlying ground truth data shows an increased fraction of DCVs as well as a higher mean distance between DCVs and AZs in dauer larvae compared to young adult hermaphrodites. Our machine learning based tools are adaptable and can be applied to study properties of different synaptic vesicle pools in electron tomograms of diverse model organisms.","5573":null,"5574":"MapReduce is emerging as a generic parallel programming paradigm for large clusters of machines. This trend combined with the growing need to run machine learning (ML) algorithms on massive datasets has led to an increased interest in implementing ML algorithms on MapReduce. However, the cost of implementing a large class of ML algorithms as low-level MapReduce jobs on varying data and machine cluster sizes can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose SystemML in which ML algorithms are expressed in a higher-level language and are compiled and executed in a MapReduce environment. This higher-level language exposes several constructs including linear algebra primitives that constitute key building blocks for a broad class of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. The algorithms expressed in SystemML are compiled and optimized into a set of MapReduce jobs that can run on a cluster of machines. We describe and empirically evaluate a number of optimization strategies for efficiently executing these algorithms on Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce implementation. We report an extensive performance evaluation on three ML algorithms on varying data and cluster sizes.","5575":"The automated categorisation (or classi\ufb01cation) of texts into topical categories has a long history,\r\ndating back at least to the early \u201960s.

Conceptualizing and structuring the nature, effect, and implementation of debiasing instruments could provide necessary guidance for practitioners investing in debiasing efforts.

We also demonstrate how our method learns an interpretable model, where annotations with alternate spellings or even languages are close in the embedding space.

Machine learning algorithms have been proposed as an alternative to conventional logistic regression for modelling PS in order to avoid limitations of linear methods. We introduce classification tree analysis (CTA) to generate PS which is a \"decision-tree\"-like classification model that provides accurate, parsimonious decision rules that are easy to display and interpret, reports P values derived via permutation tests, and evaluates cross-generalizability. METHOD Using empirical data, we identify all statistically valid CTA PS models and then use them to compute strata-specific, observation-level PS weights that are subsequently applied in outcomes analyses. We compare findings obtained using this framework to logistic regression and boosted regression, by evaluating covariate balance using standardized differences, model predictive accuracy, and treatment effect estimates obtained using median regression and a weighted CTA outcomes model. RESULTS While all models had some imbalanced covariates, main-effects logistic regression yielded the lowest average standardized difference, whereas CTA yielded the greatest predictive accuracy. Nevertheless, treatment effect estimates were generally consistent across all models. CONCLUSIONS Assessing standardized differences in means as a test of covariate balance is inappropriate for machine learning algorithms that segment the sample into two or more strata. Because the CTA algorithm identifies all statistically valid PS models for a sample, it is most likely to identify a correctly specified PS model, and should be considered as an alternative approach to modeling the PS.","5648":null,"5649":"In this paper we describe and analyze a three week\n                 assignment that was given in a Machine Learning course\n                 at Columbia University.

The MLQoE employs multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Regression machines, Decision Trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers, and tunes their hyper-parameters. It uses the Nested Cross Validation (nested CV) protocol for selecting the best classifier and the corresponding best hyper-parameter values and estimates the performance of the final model. The MLQoE is conservative in the performance estimation despite multiple induction of models. The MLQoE is modular, in that, it can be easily extended to include other ML algorithms. The MLQoE selects the ML algorithm that exhibits the best performance and its parameters automatically given the dataset used as input. It uses empirical measurements based on network metrics (e.g., packet loss, delay, and packet interarrival) and subjective opinion scores reported by actual users.

The machine classifier produced a matched accuracy (matched to the human coding) of approximately 75% for SC and 64% for WS. WS was found to be more difficult to classify by machine than SC because of the reviewers' use of more subtle language. With further training data, a machine-learning approach could be useful for automatically classifying a large number of history book reviews at once. Weighted megacitations can be especially valuable if they are used in conjunction with regular book\/journal citations, and \u201clibcitations\u201d (i.e., library holding counts) for a comprehensive assessment of a book\/monograph's scholarly impact.","5711":"The development of computer models for water quality index forecasting has been a leading research topic worldwide which has been considerably recognized over the last two decades; the balance between efficient water quality requires a good water management technique. The balance is said to be achieved through various procedures many of which require the application of computer-aided forecasting tools. In this paper, a decade research review on the water quality index in the field of artificial intelligence was carried out with the aim to present the most viable or most suitable methods and models to be adopted for future researchers in the field of water quality. The review incorporates the developed models such as ANN, ANFIS, SVM, other regression or time-series, and other soft computing models. This research shows that the study focused on a decade review of the methods and models, and also, there is room for long-term forecasts. It also shows that there is no single AI model that outperforms all the remaining AI models but It is necessary to evaluate the strength of each model combination for each region thus to know what type of method or model that works best for the country or region. The use of AI has grown significantly in recent decades however there is enough room for researchers to duel in and improve in the field of water quality index.","5712":null,"5713":"A key challenge in systems biology is the reconstruction of an organism's metabolic network from its genome sequence. One strategy for addressing this problem is to predict which metabolic pathways, from a reference database of known pathways, are present in the organism, based on the annotated genome of the organism.\n                To quantitatively validate methods for pathway prediction, we developed a large \"gold standard\" dataset of 5,610 pathway instances known to be present or absent in curated metabolic pathway databases for six organisms. We defined a collection of 123 pathway features, whose information content we evaluated with respect to the gold standard. Feature data were used as input to an extensive collection of machine learning (ML) methods, including na\u00efve Bayes, decision trees, and logistic regression, together with feature selection and ensemble methods. We compared the ML methods to the previous PathoLogic algorithm for pathway prediction using the gold standard dataset. We found that ML-based prediction methods can match the performance of the PathoLogic algorithm. PathoLogic achieved an accuracy of 91\\% and an F-measure of 0.786. The ML-based prediction methods achieved accuracy as high as 91.2\\% and F-measure as high as 0.787. The ML-based methods output a probability for each predicted pathway, whereas PathoLogic does not, which provides more information to the user and facilitates filtering of predicted pathways.\n                ML methods for pathway prediction perform as well as existing methods, and have qualitative advantages in terms of extensibility, tunability, and explainability. More advanced prediction methods and\/or more sophisticated input features may improve the performance of ML methods. However, pathway prediction performance appears to be limited largely by the ability to correctly match enzymes to the reactions they catalyze based on genome annotations.","5715":"Despite the increased sensor-based data collection in Industry 4.0, the practical use of this data is still in its infancy.

Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a solution to the task of automatic music generation (AMG) using symbolic tokens in a target style, but their superiority over non-deep learning methods has not been demonstrated. Here, we conduct a listening study to comparatively evaluate several music generation systems along six musical dimensions: stylistic success, aesthetic pleasure, repetition or self-reference, melody, harmony, and rhythm. A range of models, both deep learning algorithms and other methods, are used to generate 30-s excerpts in the style of Classical string quartets and classical piano improvisations. Fifty participants with relatively high musical knowledge rate unlabelled samples of computer-generated and human-composed excerpts for the six musical dimensions. We use non-parametric Bayesian hypothesis testing to interpret the results, allowing the possibility of finding meaningful non-differences between systems' performance. We find that the strongest deep learning method, a reimplemented version of Music Transformer, has equivalent performance to a non-deep learning method, MAIA Markov, demonstrating that to date, deep learning does not outperform other methods for AMG.

It is shown that under these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds are given on the amount of information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous.

Design For each mention of each medical problem, both approaches determine whether the problem, as asserted by the context of that mention, is present, absent, or uncertain in the patient, or associated with someone other than the patient. The authors use these two systems to (1) extend negation and uncertainty extraction to recognition of alter-association assertions, (2) determine the contribution of lexical and syntactic context to assertion classification, and (3) test if a machine learning approach to assertion classification can be as generally applicable and useful as its rule-based counterparts.  Measurements The authors evaluated assertion classification approaches with precision, recall, and F-measure.  Results The ENegEx algorithm is a general algorithm that can be directly applied to new corpora.

CMA includes a group of scientific software tools, machine learning algorithms, and a large scale cell image repository.

Different machine learning algorithms integrated with image processing techniques were used to automate the selection and validation of the massive scale image data in CMA. An experiment based technique guided by a feature selection algorithm was introduced in the framework to select optimal machine learning features. An iterative metamorphic testing approach is applied for testing the scientific software. Due to the non-testable characteristic of the scientific software, a machine learning approach is introduced for developing test oracles iteratively to ensure the adequacy of the test coverage criteria. Performance of the machine learning algorithms is evaluated with the stratified N-fold cross validation and confusion matrix.

Schon in der heutigen Zeit nimmt es bereits einen gro\u00dfen Teil ein. Dies f\u00fchrt dazu, dass Netzwerkprovider herausfinden m\u00fcssen, wie sie mit der Masse an Verkehr umgehen sollen, um gleichzeitig ihre Kunden zufrieden stellen zu k\u00f6nnen. Eine Metrik, um die Nutzerzufriedenheit festzustellen, ist Quality of Experience (QoE). Mit Hilfe von QoE-Management k\u00f6nnen Provider anhand des Datenverkehrs die Zufriedenheit der Kunden beeinflussen und trotzdem die Kosteneffizienz zu wahren. Ein wichtiger Teil vom QoE-Management ist das QoE-Monitoring. Da allerdings der Netzwerkverkehr verschl\u00fcsselt ist und deshalb deep packet inspection nicht mehr verwendet werden kann, muss auf statistische Analysen zur\u00fcck gegriffen werden. Das Ziel der Arbeit ist es, wichtige QoE-Einflussfaktoren f\u00fcr Mobile Video Stream- ing, speziell am Beispiel YouTube, zu finden mit Hilfe von Machine Learning (ML). Um die Daten zu sammeln, wurde ein Versuchsaufbau bestehend aus einer Linux- Maschine und einem Smartphone benutzt, wobei der PC als Router f\u00fcr das Smartphone zum Internet diente. Auf dem Smartphone lief die originale YouTube-App, welche auch im Google Play Store erh\u00e4ltlich ist, sowie eine Wrapper-App f\u00fcr das Monitoring. Diese kann autonom die YouTube-App starten und Videos abspielen. W\u00e4hrend ein Video l\u00e4uft werden Netzwerk- und Anwendungsinformationen gesam- melt und auf dem Ger\u00e4t in einer separaten Datei gespeichert. Mit diesen Daten konnten drei verschiedene Datens\u00e4tze gemessen werden, wobei zwei zur QoE-Vorhersage f\u00fcr initial delay und der dritte Datensatz zur QoE-Vorhersage for stalling events verwendet wurden. Der erste Datensatz bestand aus drei ver- schiedenen Videos und 1070 Instanzen, der zweite Datensatz aus 18 Videos und 1400 Instanzen und der letzte Datensatz aus 930 Instanzen sowie drei Videos. Des Weiteren wurden die Videos mit verschiedenen Bandbreitenbegrenzungen abgespielt, welche von 0.5 Mbits\/s bis 5 Mbits\/s reichten. Um die Datens\u00e4tze mit ML klas- sifizieren zu k\u00f6nnen, mussten die Instanzen zuvor in vordefinierte Klassen anhand ihres initial delay oder ihrer Anzahl an stallings aufgeteilt werden. Versuche mit dem ersten Datensatz zeigten, dass QoE-Sch\u00e4tzungen mit drei Videos nicht aussagekr\u00e4ftig genug sind. Anhand der Ergebnisse mit dem zweiten Datensatz konnten aber folgende wichtige Einflussparameter festgestellt werden: der gesamte Durchsatz von Up- und Downlink, sowie der Durchsatz in den ersten 20 Sekunden. Einflussreiche Parameter sind au\u00dferdem der Durchsatz der ersten f\u00fcnf Segmente, welche nicht leer sind, und deren Gr\u00f6\u00dfe. Im Anschluss daran wurden weitere QoE-Vorhersagen mit verschiedenen Klassen- aufteilungen gemacht. Es stellte sich heraus, dass die Genauigkeit der Vorhersagen mit steigender Klassenzahl stark nachl\u00e4sst. Des Weiteren wurden Sch\u00e4tzungen mit Klassenaufteilungen aus anderen QoE-Studien auf unsere Datens\u00e4tze angewendet, welche allerdings keine weiteren Erkenntnisse lieferten.

The article\n                 is organized according to the major ML paradigms that\n                 are either popular already or have potential for making\n                 significant contributions to ASR technology. The\n                 paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview\n                 include: generative and discriminative learning;\n                 supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active\n                 learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and\n                 Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are\n                 motivated and discussed in the context of ASR\n                 technology and applications. We finally present and\n                 analyze recent developments of deep learning and\n                 learning with sparse representations, focusing on their\n                 direct relevance to advancing ASR technology.","5835":"Three-point and high-order clustering statistics of the high-redshift 21cm\r\nsignal contain valuable information about the Epoch of Reionization. We present\r\n3PCF-Fast, an optimised code for estimating the three-point correlation\r\nfunction of 3D pixelised data such as the outputs from numerical and\r\nsemi-numerical simulations. After testing 3PCF-Fast on data with known analytic\r\nthree-point correlation function, we use machine learning techniques to recover\r\nthe mean bubble size and global ionisation fraction from correlations in the\r\noutputs of the publicly available 21cmFAST code. We assume that foregrounds\r\nhave been perfectly removed and negligible instrumental noise. Using ionisation\r\nfraction data, our best MLP model recovers the mean bubble size with a median\r\nprediction error of around 10%, or from the 21cm differential brightness\r\ntemperature with median prediction error of around 14%. A further two MLP\r\nmodels recover the global ionisation fraction with median prediction errors of\r\naround 4% (using ionisation fraction data) or around 16% (using brightness\r\ntemperature). Our results indicate that clustering in both the ionisation\r\nfraction field and the brightness temperature field encode useful information\r\nabout the progress of the Epoch of Reionization in a complementary way to other\r\nsummary statistics. Using clustering would be particularly useful in regimes\r\nwhere high signal-to-noise ratio prevents direct measurement of bubble size\r\nstatistics. We compare the quality of MLP models using the power spectrum, and\r\nfind that using the three-point correlation function outperforms the power\r\nspectrum at predicting both global ionisation fraction and mean bubble size.","5836":"Background: The concept of boosting emerged from the field of machine learning.\nThe basic idea is to boost the accuracy of a weak classifying tool by combining various instances into a more accurate prediction. This general concept was later adapted to the field of statistical modelling. Nowadays, boosting algorithms are often applied to estimate and select predictor effects in statistical regression models.\nObjectives: This review article attempts to highlight the evolution of boosting algorithms from machine learning to statistical modelling.\nMethods: We describe the AdaBoost algorithm for classification as well as the two most prominent statistical boosting approaches, gradient boosting and likelihood-based\nboosting for statistical modelling. We highlight the methodological background and present the most common software implementations.\nResults: Although gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting are typically\ntreated separately in the literature, they share the same methodological roots and follow the same fundamental concepts. Compared to the initial machine learning algorithms, which must be seen as black-box prediction schemes, they result in statistical models with a straight-forward interpretation.\nConclusions: Statistical boosting algorithms have gained substantial interest during the last decade and offer a variety of options to address important research questions in modern biomedicine.","5837":null,"5838":"Machine learning algorithms, when applied to sensitive data, pose a distinct\r\nthreat to privacy. A growing body of prior work demonstrates that models\r\nproduced by these algorithms may leak specific private information in the\r\ntraining data to an attacker, either through the models' structure or their\r\nobservable behavior. However, the underlying cause of this privacy risk is not\r\nwell understood beyond a handful of anecdotal accounts that suggest overfitting\r\nand influence might play a role.\r\n  This paper examines the effect that overfitting and influence have on the\r\nability of an attacker to learn information about the training data from\r\nmachine learning models, either through training set membership inference or\r\nattribute inference attacks. Using both formal and empirical analyses, we\r\nillustrate a clear relationship between these factors and the privacy risk that\r\narises in several popular machine learning algorithms. We find that overfitting\r\nis sufficient to allow an attacker to perform membership inference and, when\r\nthe target attribute meets certain conditions about its influence, attribute\r\ninference attacks. Interestingly, our formal analysis also shows that\r\noverfitting is not necessary for these attacks and begins to shed light on what\r\nother factors may be in play. Finally, we explore the connection between\r\nmembership inference and attribute inference, showing that there are deep\r\nconnections between the two that lead to effective new attacks.","5839":"Rapidly discovering functional materials remains an open challenge because the traditional trial-and-error methods are usually inefficient especially when thousands of candidates are treated. Here, we develop a target-driven method to predict undiscovered hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) for photovoltaics. This strategy, combining machine learning techniques and density functional theory calculations, aims to quickly screen the HOIPs based on bandgap and solve the problems of toxicity and poor environmental stability in HOIPs. Successfully, six orthorhombic lead-free HOIPs with proper bandgap for solar cells and room temperature thermal stability are screened out from 5158 unexplored HOIPs and two of them stand out with direct bandgaps in the visible region and excellent environmental stability. Essentially, a close structure-property relationship mapping the HOIPs bandgap is established. Our method can achieve high accuracy in a flash and be applicable to a broad class of functional material design.","5840":"Online communities are attractive sources of ideas relevant for new product development and innovation. However, making sense of the \u2018big data\u2019 in these communities is a complex analytical task. A systematic way of dealing with these data is needed to exploit their potential for boosting companies' innovation performance. We propose a method for analysing online community data with a special focus on identifying ideas. We employ a research design where two human raters classified 3,000 texts extracted from an online community, according to whether the text contained an idea. Among the 3,000, 137 idea texts and 2,666 non-idea texts were identified. The human raters could not agree on the remaining 197 texts. These texts were omitted from the analysis. The remaining 2,803 texts were processed by using text mining techniques and used to train a classification model. We describe how to tune the model and which text mining steps to perform. We conclude that machine learning and text mining can be useful for detecting ideas in online communities. The method can help researchers and firms identify ideas hidden in large amounts of texts. Also, it is interesting in its own right that machine learning can be used to detect ideas.","5841":null,"5842":null,"5843":null,"5844":null,"5845":null,"5846":null,"5847":null,"5848":null,"5849":"In designing a spoken dialogue system, developers need to specify the actions a system should take in response to user speech input and the state of the environment based on observed or inferred events, states, and beliefs.

However, the detection of such \u201cselective sweeps\u201d is complicated by demographic events, such as population expansion, which can produce similar skews in genetic diversity. Here, we present a method for detecting selective sweeps that is remarkably powerful and robust to potentially confounding demographic histories. This method, called S\/HIC, operates using a machine learning paradigm to combine many different features of population genetic variation, and examine their values across a large genomic region in order to infer whether a selective sweep has recently occurred near its center. S\/HIC is also able to accurately distinguish between selection acting on de novo beneficial mutations (\u201chard sweeps\u201d) and selection on previously standing variants (\u201csoft sweeps\u201d).

Resistance is usually selected by the antibiotic itself; however, biocides might also co-select for resistance to antibiotics. Although resistance to biocides is poorly defined, different in vitro studies have shown that mutants presenting low susceptibility to biocides also have reduced susceptibility to antibiotics. However, studies with natural bacterial isolates are more limited and there are no clear conclusions as to whether the use of biocides results in the development of multidrug resistant bacteria.The main goal is to perform an unbiased blind-based evaluation of the relationship between antibiotic and biocide reduced susceptibility in natural isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. One of the largest data sets ever studied comprising 1632 human clinical isolates of S. aureus originated worldwide was analysed. The phenotypic characterization of 13 antibiotics and 4 biocides was performed for all the strains. Complex links between reduced susceptibility to biocides and antibiotics are difficult to elucidate using the standard statistical approaches in phenotypic data. Therefore, machine learning techniques were applied to explore the data.In this pioneer study, we demonstrated that reduced susceptibility to two common biocides, chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride, which belong to different structural families, is associated to multidrug resistance. We have consistently found that a minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 2 mg\/L for both biocides is related to antibiotic non-susceptibility in S. aureus.Two important results emerged from our work, one methodological and one other with relevance in the field of antibiotic resistance. We could not conclude on whether the use of antibiotics selects for biocide resistance or vice versa. However, the observation of association between multiple resistance and two biocides commonly used may be of concern for the treatment of infectious diseases in the future.","5881":"Detecting out-of-distribution inputs is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world.

Our method is motivated by the analysis that the norm of the logit keeps increasing during training, leading to overconfident output.

Trained with LogitNorm, neural networks produce highly distinguishable confidence scores between in- and out-of-distribution data.

We focus in this paper on Sinkhorn divergences (SDs), a regularized variant of OT distances which can interpolate, depending on the regularization strength $\\varepsilon$, between OT ($\\varepsilon=0$) and MMD ($\\varepsilon=\u0131nfty$). Although the tradeoff induced by that regularization is now well understood computationally (OT, SDs and MMD require respectively $O(n^3n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $n^2$ operations given a sample size $n$), much less is known in terms of their sample complexity, namely the gap between these quantities, when evaluated using finite samples vs. their respective densities. Indeed, while the sample complexity of OT and MMD stand at two extremes, $1\/n^1\/d$ for OT in dimension $d$ and $1\/n$ for MMD, that for SDs has only been studied empirically. In this paper, we (i) derive a bound on the approximation error made with SDs when approximating OT as a function of the regularizer $\\varepsilon$, (ii) prove that the optimizers of regularized OT are bounded in a Sobolev (RKHS) ball independent of the two measures and (iii) provide the first sample complexity bound for SDs, obtained,by reformulating SDs as a maximization problem in a RKHS.

Mining the relationship between environmental and genetic factors and metabolic fluxes hidden in existing fluxomic data will lead to predictive models that can significantly accelerate flux quantification. In this paper, we present a web-based platform MFlux (http:\/\/mflux.org) that predicts the bacterial central metabolism via machine learning, leveraging data from approximately 100 13C-MFA papers on heterotrophic bacterial metabolisms. Three machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Tree, were employed to study the sophisticated relationship between influential factors and metabolic fluxes. We performed a grid search of the best parameter set for each algorithm and verified their performance through 10-fold cross validations. SVM yields the highest accuracy among all three algorithms. Further, we employed quadratic programming to adjust flux profiles to satisfy stoichiometric constraints. Multiple case studies have shown that MFlux can reasonably predict fluxomes as a function of bacterial species, substrate types, growth rate, oxygen conditions, and cultivation methods. Due to the interest of studying model organism under particular carbon sources, bias of fluxome in the dataset may limit the applicability of machine learning models. This problem can be resolved after more papers on 13C-MFA are published for non-model species. Metabolic information is important for disease treatment, bioprocess optimization, environmental remediation, biogeochemical cycle regulation, and our understanding of life's origin and evolution. 13C-MFA can quantify microbial physiology at the level of metabolic reaction rates. To speed up microbial characterizations and fluxomic studies, we hypothesize that genetic and environmental factors generate specific fluxome patterns that can be recognized by machine learning. Aided by constraint programming and quadratic optimization, our platform based on machine learning (ML) can predict meaningful metabolic information about bacterial species in their environments. Further, it can offer constraints to improve the accuracy of flux balance analysis. This study infers that the bacterial metabolic network has a certain degree of rigidity in allocating carbon fluxes, and different microbial species may share common regulatory strategies for balancing carbon and energy metabolisms. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the use of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, e.g., ML, may assist mechanistic based models to elucidate the topology of microbial fluxomes.","5891":"OpenStreetMap is a unique source of openly available worldwide map data, increasingly adopted in real-world applications.

LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings together with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a different type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD finds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of information.

Due to the novel way data were split with respect to training and testing data, it becomes possible to predict entire stress-strain curves which leads to a reduction in the number of required laboratory experiments, finally saving costs and time in future experiments. While all investigated ML methods showed a higher performance than the Z-A model, the extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGB) showed the superior results, i.e., highest error reduction of 91% with respect to the Mean Squared Error.","5906":"A vast majority of machine learning algorithms train their models and perform\r\ninference by solving optimization problems. In order to capture the learning\r\nand prediction problems accurately, structural constraints such as sparsity or\r\nlow rank are frequently imposed or else the objective itself is designed to be\r\na non-convex function. This is especially true of algorithms that operate in\r\nhigh-dimensional spaces or that train non-linear models such as tensor models\r\nand deep networks.\r\n  The freedom to express the learning problem as a non-convex optimization\r\nproblem gives immense modeling power to the algorithm designer, but often such\r\nproblems are NP-hard to solve. A popular workaround to this has been to relax\r\nnon-convex problems to convex ones and use traditional methods to solve the\r\n(convex) relaxed optimization problems. However this approach may be lossy and\r\nnevertheless presents significant challenges for large scale optimization.\r\n  On the other hand, direct approaches to non-convex optimization have met with\r\nresounding success in several domains and remain the methods of choice for the\r\npractitioner, as they frequently outperform relaxation-based techniques -\r\npopular heuristics include projected gradient descent and alternating\r\nminimization. However, these are often poorly understood in terms of their\r\nconvergence and other properties.\r\n  This monograph presents a selection of recent advances that bridge a\r\nlong-standing gap in our understanding of these heuristics. The monograph will\r\nlead the reader through several widely used non-convex optimization techniques,\r\nas well as applications thereof. The goal of this monograph is to both,\r\nintroduce the rich literature in this area, as well as equip the reader with\r\nthe tools and techniques needed to analyze these simple procedures for\r\nnon-convex problems.","5907":null,"5908":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box predictors that have\r\nachieved impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks.

These models predict the wind power generation of wind farms or entire regions more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms or physical models. However, latest research has shown that deep learning models can often be manipulated by adversarial attacks. Since wind power forecasts are essential for the stability of modern power systems, it is important to protect them from this threat. In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of two different forecasting models to targeted, semi-targeted, and untargeted adversarial attacks. We consider a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for predicting the power generation of individual wind farms and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for forecasting the wind power generation throughout Germany. Moreover, we propose the Total Adversarial Robustness Score (TARS), an evaluation metric for quantifying the robustness of regression models to targeted and semi-targeted adversarial attacks. It assesses the impact of attacks on the model's performance, as well as the extent to which the attacker's goal was achieved, by assigning a score between 0 (very vulnerable) and 1 (very robust). In our experiments, the LSTM forecasting model was fairly robust and achieved a TARS value of over 0.78 for all adversarial attacks investigated. The CNN forecasting model only achieved TARS values below 0.10 when trained ordinarily, and was thus very vulnerable. Yet, its robustness could be significantly improved by adversarial training, which always resulted in a TARS above 0.46.","5910":"The diagnosis of heart disease depends mostly on the combination of clinical and pathological data.

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.","5913":"The diagnosis of heart disease depends mostly on the combination of clinical and pathological data.

Due to the low sampling rate of quality variables, most of the soft sensors are developed on small number of labeled samples and the large number of unlabeled process data is discarded. The loss of information greatly limits the improvement of quality prediction accuracy. One of the main issues of data-driven soft sensor is to furthest exploit the information contained in all available process data. This paper proposes a semisupervised deep learning model for soft sensor development based on the hierarchical extreme learning machine (HELM). First, the deep network structure of autoencoders is implemented for unsupervised feature extraction with all the process samples. Then, extreme learning machine is utilized for regression through appending the quality variable. Meanwhile, the manifold regularization method is introduced for semisupervised model training. The new method can not only deeply extract the information that the data contains, but learn more from the extra unlabeled samples as well. The proposed semisupervised HELM method is applied in a high-low transformer to estimate the carbon monoxide content, which shows a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy, compared to traditional methods.","5920":null,"5921":"BACKGROUND:Identifying essential genes in bacteria supports to identify potential drug targets and an understanding of minimal requirements for a synthetic cell. However, experimentally assaying the essentiality of their coding genes is resource intensive and not feasible for all bacterial organisms, in particular if they are infective.RESULTS:We developed a machine learning technique to identify essential genes using the experimental data of genome-wide knock-out screens from one bacterial organism to infer essential genes of another related bacterial organism. We used a broad variety of topological features, sequence characteristics and co-expression properties potentially associated with essentiality, such as flux deviations, centrality, codon frequencies of the sequences, co-regulation and phyletic retention. An organism-wise cross-validation on bacterial species yielded reliable results with good accuracies (area under the receiver-operator-curve of 75\\% - 81\\%). Finally, it was applied to drug target predictions for Salmonella typhimurium. We compared our predictions to the viability of experimental knock-outs of S. typhimurium and identified 35 enzymes, which are highly relevant to be considered as potential drug targets. Specifically, we detected promising drug targets in the non-mevalonate pathway.CONCLUSIONS:Using elaborated features characterizing network topology, sequence information and microarray data enables to predict essential genes from a bacterial reference organism to a related query organism without any knowledge about the essentiality of genes of the query organism.

To boost the performance of these machine techniques, we exploit several feature selection methods and propose coupling feature selection with classification approaches to achieve the best performance.

The XOR Arbiter PUF (XOR PUF or XPUF) is an intensively studied PUF invented to improve the security of the Arbiter PUF, probably the most lightweight delay-based PUF. Recently, highly powerful machine learning attack methods were discovered and were able to easily break large-sized XPUFs, which were highly secure against earlier machine learning attack methods. Component-differentially-challenged XPUFs (CDC-XPUFs) are XPUFs with different component PUFs receiving different challenges. Studies showed they were much more secure against machine learning attacks than the conventional XPUFs, whose component PUFs receive the same challenge. But these studies were all based on earlier machine learning attack methods, and hence it is not clear if CDC-XPUFs can remain secure under the recently discovered powerful attack methods. In this paper, the two current most powerful two machine learning methods for attacking XPUFs are adapted by fine-tuning the parameters of the two methods for CDCXPUFs. Attack experiments using both simulated PUF data and silicon data generated from PUFs implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) were carried out, and the experimental results showed that some previously secure CDC-XPUFs of certain circuit parameter values are no longer secure under the adapted new attack methods, while many more CDC-XPUFs of other circuit parameter values remain secure. Thus, our experimental attack study has re-defined the boundary between the secure region and the insecure region of the PUF circuit parameter space, providing PUF manufacturers and IoT security application developers with valuable information in choosing PUFs with secure parameter values.","5946":"While explanations may help people learn by providing information about why an answer is correct, many problems on online platforms lack high-quality explanations.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query augmentation for SPARQL endpoints based on machine learning. Our approach separates the structure of the query from its contents and measures two types of similarity, which are then used to predict the structure and contents of the augmented query. We test the approach on the real-world query logs of the Spanish and English DBpedia and show that our approach yields high-accuracy prediction. We also show that, by caching the results of the predicted augmented queries, we can retrieve data relevant to several subsequent queries at once, achieving a higher cache hit rate than previous approaches.","5962":"This paper presents a method that assists in maintaining a rule-based named-entity recognition and classification system. The underlying idea is to use a separate system, constructed with the use of machine learning, to monitor the performance of the rule-based system. The training data for the second system is generated with the use of the rule-based system, thus avoiding the need for manual tagging. The disagreement of the two systems acts as a signal for updating the rule-based system. The generality of the approach is illustrated by applying it to large corpora in two different languages: Greek and French. The results are very encouraging, showing that this alternative use of machine learning can assist significantly in the maintenance of rule-based systems.","5963":null,"5964":"Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest.

The relationship between the variables to be predicted is often complex. An example of such complex dependencies is machine translation, where the input is a sequence of words in the source natural language and the output is a sequence of words in the target natural language. Here, each word in the target language relates not only to the words in the source language, but also to the other (arbitrarily far) words in the target sequence. As a field, structured prediction has some unique challenges, several of which are addressed by the papers in this issue. One of the most obvious of these is that the output spaces in question are often exponential in size, and so the complexity, both of these spaces and the learned models, can result in computationally infeasible learning and inference algorithms. In many cases, therefore, efficient optimization remains an open problem in structured prediction.","5969":"In this paper an ensemble of supervised machine learning methods has been investigated to virtually and dynamically calibrate the cosmic ray sensors measuring area wise bulk soil moisture. Main focus of this study was to find an alternative to the currently available field calibration method; based on expensive and time consuming soil sample collection methodology. Data from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) database was used as independent soil moisture ground truth and results were compared against the conventionally estimated soil moisture using a Hydroinnova CRS-1000 cosmic ray probe deployed in Tullochgorum, Australia. Prediction performance of a complementary ensemble of four supervised estimators, namely Sugano type Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (S-ANFIS), Cascade Forward Neural Network (CFNN), Elman Neural Network (ENN) and Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network (LVQN) was evaluated using training and testing paradigms. An AWAP trained ensemble of four estimators was able to predict bulk soil moisture directly from cosmic ray neutron counts with 94.4\\% as best accuracy. The ensemble approach outperformed the individual performances from these networks. This result proved that an ensemble machine learning based paradigm could be a valuable alternative data driven calibration method for cosmic ray sensors against the current expensive and hydrological assumption based field calibration method.","5970":null,"5971":null,"5972":null,"5973":"Until now, computer vision and machine learning techniques barely\n\tcontributed to the archaeological domain.

Furthermore, phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinase enzymes and hence the kinase information of the phosphorylated sites has been used as major classification data in most of the existing systems. Since the number of kinase annotations in protein sequences is far less than that of the proteins being sequenced to date, the prediction systems that use the information found from the small clique of kinase annotated proteins can not be considered as completely perfect for predicting outside the clique. Hence the systems are certainly not generalized. In this paper, a novel generalized prediction system, PPRED (Phosphorylation PREDictor) is proposed that ignores the kinase information and only uses the evolutionary information of proteins for classifying phosphorylation sites. RESULTS: Experimental results based on cross validations and an independent benchmark reveal the significance of using the evolutionary information alone to classify phosphorylation sites from protein sequences. The prediction performance of the proposed system is better than those of the existing prediction systems that also do not incorporate kinase information. The system is also comparable to systems that incorporate kinase information in predicting such sites. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented in this paper provides an efficient way to identify phosphorylation sites in a given protein primary sequence that would be a valuable information for the molecular biologists working on protein phosphorylation sites and for bioinformaticians developing generalized prediction systems for the post translational modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.","6282":"We propose a new document vector representation specifically designed for the document clustering task.

Especially, when it comes to medieval scripts. The complexity is mainly affected by the poor quality and the small quantity of the data available. In this paper we apply an HMM based recognition system to medieval manuscripts from the 13th century written in Middle High German. The recognition system, which was originally developed for modern scripts, has been adapted to medieval scripts. Beside the data processing, one of the major challenges is to create a suitable language model. Because of the lack of appropriate independent text corpora for medieval languages, the language model has to be created on the base of a rather small number of manuscripts only. Due to the small size of the corpus, optimizing the language model parameters can quickly lead to the problem of overfitting. In this paper we describe a strategy to integrate all available information into the language model and to optimize the language model parameters without suffering from this problem.","6294":null,"6295":null,"6296":"Task-oriented dialogue is often decomposed into three tasks: understanding\r\nuser input, deciding actions, and generating a response.

Recently, it has also been applied to information retrieval. According to this new paradigm, each document is viewed as a language sample, and a query as a generation process. The retrieved documents are ranked based on the probabilities of producing a query from the corresponding language models of these documents. In this paper, we will present a new language model for information retrieval, which is based on a range of data smoothing techniques, including the Good-Turning estimate, curve-fitting functions, and model combinations. Our model is conceptually simple and intuitive, and can be easily extended to incorporate probabilities of phrases such as word pairs and word triples. The experiments with the Wall Street Journal and TREC4 data sets showed that the performance of our model is comparable to that of INQUERY and better than that of another language model for information retrieval. In particular, word pairs are shown to be useful in improving the retrieval performance.","6298":"This article provides information on education models.

Cross-entropy loss has several shortcomings that can lead to sub-optimal\r\ngeneralization and instability. Driven by the intuition that good\r\ngeneralization requires capturing the similarity between examples in one class\r\nand contrasting them with examples in other classes, we propose a supervised\r\ncontrastive learning (SCL) objective for the fine-tuning stage. Combined with\r\ncross-entropy, the SCL loss we propose obtains improvements over a strong\r\nRoBERTa-Large baseline on multiple datasets of the GLUE benchmark in both the\r\nhigh-data and low-data regimes, and it does not require any specialized\r\narchitecture, data augmentation of any kind, memory banks, or additional\r\nunsupervised data.

To alleviate this problem we propose an approach which encompasses (i) a language for concisely describing fault-tolerant distributed algorithms and (ii) a translator from the proposed language to PROMELA, the input language of the SPIN model checker. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we show the results of an experiment where we described and verified several algorithms for consensus, a well-known distributed agreement problem.","6305":"We present a specification language called Action Language for model checking software specifications.

However,\r\nmanually creating unit tests is a laborious task, motivating the need for\r\nautomation.

TestPilot uses Codex, an\r\noff-the-shelf LLM, to automatically generate unit tests for a given program\r\nwithout requiring additional training or few-shot learning on examples of\r\nexisting tests. In our approach, Codex is provided with prompts that include\r\nthe signature and implementation of a function under test, along with usage\r\nexamples extracted from documentation. If a generated test fails, TestPilot's\r\nadaptive component attempts to generate a new test that fixes the problem by\r\nre-prompting the model with the failing test and error message.

In this paper, we propose Sophia,\r\nSecond-order Clipped Stochastic Optimization, a simple scalable second-order\r\noptimizer that uses a light-weight estimate of the diagonal Hessian as the\r\npre-conditioner. The update is the moving average of the gradients divided by\r\nthe moving average of the estimated Hessian, followed by element-wise clipping.\r\nThe clipping controls the worst-case update size and tames the negative impact\r\nof non-convexity and rapid change of Hessian along the trajectory. Sophia only\r\nestimates the diagonal Hessian every handful of iterations, which has\r\nnegligible average per-step time and memory overhead.

The results suggest that on many\r\nlanguages, character inputs are sufficient for language modeling.

We present a usagebased computational model of language acquisition which learns in a purely incremental fashion,\r\nthrough on-line processing based on chunking, and which offers broad, cross-linguistic coverage while\r\nuniting key aspects of comprehension and production within a single framework. The model\u2019s design\r\nreflects memory constraints imposed by the real-time nature of language processing, and is inspired by\r\npsycholinguistic evidence for children's sensitivity to the distributional properties of multi-word\r\nsequences and for shallow language comprehension based on local information. It learns from corpora\r\nof child-directed speech, chunking incoming words together to incrementally build an item-based\r\n\u201cshallow parse.\u201d When the model encounters an utterance made by the target child, it attempts to\r\ngenerate an identical utterance using the same chunks and statistics involved during comprehension.\r\nHigh performance is achieved on both comprehension- and production-related tasks: the model\u2019s\r\nshallow parsing is evaluated across 79 single-child corpora spanning English, French, and German,\r\nwhile its production performance is evaluated across over 200 single-child corpora representing 29\r\nlanguages from the CHILDES database. The model also succeeds in capturing findings from children\u2019s\r\nproduction of complex sentence types. Together, our modeling results suggest that much of children's\r\nearly linguistic behavior may be supported by item-based learning through on-line processing of simple\r\ndistributional cues, consistent with the notion that acquisition can be understood as learning to process\r\nlanguage.","6319":"The phenomenon of human language is widely studied from various points of view.

In this paper we describe a techniquefor representing reusable modeling experiences. The techniqueallows developers to express domain-specific designpatterns as a sub-language of the modeling language,the UML. Use of the sub-language to build application-specificUML models results in the reuse of the embeddeddesign experiences. We use a notation called the (meta-)Role-Based Modeling Language (RBML) to define UMLsub-languages. A (meta-)Role Model is a specializationof the UML (Unified Modeling Language) meta-model,that is, it determines a sub-language of the UML. We showhow RBML can be used to define domain-specific designpatterns.Keywords: Object-oriented design models, role-basedmodeling language, software reuse, UML","6321":"We present the model transformation language of the VIATRA2 framework, which provides a rule- and pattern-based transformation language for manipulating graph models by combining graph transformation and abstract state machines into a single specification paradigm.

This is intrinsically dif\ufb01cult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to \ufb01ght the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a signi\ufb01cant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach signi\ufb01cantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.","6328":"Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to develop a cross-language personalized recommendation model based on web log mining, which can recommend academic articles, in different languages, to users according to their demands.

In terms of open education, the workshop model can be viewed as an open production process for developing educational resources, in our case design patterns. We propose a model of pattern elicitation workshops, in which collaborative development of a pattern language provides a framework for sharing design knowledge within interdisciplinary communities.

Unfortunately, for years the results of exploiting such dependencies have been mixed or inconclusive. To improve the situation, this paper shows how the natural language properties of the target documents can be used to transform and enrich the term dependencies to more useful statistics. This is done in three steps. The term co-occurrence statistics of queries and documents are each represented by a Markov chain. The paper proves that such a chain is ergodic, and therefore its asymptotic behavior is unique, stationary, and independent of the initial state. Next, the stationary distribution is taken to model queries and documents, rather than their initial distributions. Finally, ranking is achieved following the customary language modeling paradigm. The main contribution of this paper is to argue why the asymptotic behavior of the document model is a better representation then just the document\u2019s initial distribution. A secondary contribution is to investigate the practical application of this representation in case the queries become increasingly verbose. In the experiments (based on Lemur\u2019s search engine substrate) the default query model was replaced by the stable distribution of the query. Just modeling the query this way already resulted in significant improvements over a standard language model baseline. The results were on a par or better than more sophisticated algorithms that use fine-tuned parameters or extensive training. Moreover, the more verbose the query, the more effective the approach seems to become.","6386":"Domain-specific visual languages (DSVLs) are concise and useful tools that allow the rapid development of the behavior and\/or structure of applications in well-defined domains.

We can experience these types of scenarios when we shop online in some interfaces like amazon e bay flip kart etc. Of course there are many existing systems which give a rating to the product that help the buyer to trust the seller and buy the product. Still there is an issue of being cheated by some wrong reviews given by unauthenticated users. In order to overcome that type of issues this Real Dynamic Cyber Trust Model has been proposed. A Real Dynamic Cyber Trust Model has taken the scenario of seller and buyer who goes shopping for products online. This Real Dynamic Cyber Trust model acts as an interface between the Seller and Buyer. Both Modules of Seller and Buyer have the opportunity of getting registered and log in to the application. Buyer can give the feedback of any product he buys and checks the trust factor of any seller. Whereas the Seller can add update or delete the products he sells. Based on the feedback given by the buyer the Real Dynamic Cyber Trust Model calculates the trust factor of the seller which helps the buyer to find out whether the seller is trustworthy or not.

Starting with a set of labeler-written\r\nprompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of\r\nlabeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune\r\nGPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model\r\noutputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using\r\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models\r\nInstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the\r\n1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3,\r\ndespite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show\r\nimprovements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while\r\nhaving minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though\r\nInstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with\r\nhuman feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human\r\nintent.","6418":"Computer-based systems for communication with humans are a cornerstone of AI research since the 1950s.

In this paper, we analyze these approaches, and based on this analysis, we re-think the meta-model architecture focusing on complete language specifications. In our meta-model architecture, each aspect of a language conforms to an aspect-specific meta-language at the level above, and models can reside at different levels depending on their context and use.

As learnt from years of experience in development of complex software systems, languages need to support some form of component-based development. Components enable higher software quality, better understanding and reusability of already developed artifacts. Any component approach contains an underlying component model, a description detailing what valid components are and how components can interact. With the multitude of languages developed for the Semantic Web, what are their underlying component models? Do we need to develop one for each language, or is a more general and reusable approach achievable? We present a language-driven component model specification approach. This means that a component model can be (automatically) generated from a given base language (actually, its specification, e.g. its grammar). As a consequence, we can provide components for different languages and simplify the development of software artifacts used on the Semantic Web.","6558":null,"6559":null,"6560":null,"6561":null,"6562":null,"6563":"Neural language representation models such as BERT 1 have recently shown state of the art performance in downstream NLP tasks and bio-medical domain adaptation of BERT (Bio-BERT 2) has shown same behavior on biomedical text mining tasks.

The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo\/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution.

With the adoption of the OMG QVT standard for model transformation languages, it is anticipated that the experience in applying model transformations in various domains will increase. However, the QVT standard is just one possible approach for solving model transformation problems. In parallel with the QVT activity, many research groups and companies have been working on their own model transformation approaches and languages. It is important for software developers to be able to compare and select the most suitable languages and tools for a particular problem. This paper compares several model-to-model transformation languages as a step in the direction of gathering knowledge about the existing model transformation approaches. The focus is on the major language components (sublanguages and their features, execution tools, etc.) and how they are related. The major goal is to motivate the need for language interoperability and to explore options and obstacles for such interoperability. We propose a set of heuristics to reason about the problems that must be addressed when translators between languages have to be developed. These heuristics are applied on several examples. The experience from these examples shows that achieving a large degree of interoperability is difficult since some languages expose incompatible features. We managed to identify, however, cases where the interoperability between languages is feasible and brings certain benefits.","6580":"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between smoothing in language models and idf weights. Language models regard the relative within-document-frequency and the relative collection frequency; idf weights are very similar to the latter, but yield higher weights for rare terms. Regarding the correlation between the language model parameters and relevance for two test collections, we find that the idf type of weighting seems to be more appropriate. Based on the observed correlation, we devise empirical smoothing as a new type of term weighting for language models, and retrieval experiments confirm the general applicability of our method. Finally, we show that the most appropriate form of describing the relationship between the language model parameters and relevance seems to be a product form, which confirms a language model proposed before.","6581":"Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative\r\ncapabilities with increasing scale.

What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness, transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent abilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT\/GPT-3 family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.","6702":"In this paper, we define and apply representational stability analysis\r\n(ReStA), an intuitive way of analyzing neural language models.

Within UML, OCL is the standard for specifying expressions that add vital information to object-oriented models and other object-modeling artifacts. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) relies on OCL to add the level of programming detail necessary to enable platform-specific models (PSM) to communicate with platform-independent models (PIM).\r\n\r\nThis book is a practical, accessible guide to OCL for software architects, designers, and developers. Much care has been taken during the redesign of OCL to ensure that the syntax remains readable and writable by the average software modeler.
